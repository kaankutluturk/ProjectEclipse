# Regression tests and validators

Run these commands from the repository root. Runners and their C# fixtures stay
together here; generated sources, binaries, logs and isolated projects go under
ignored `Temp/`. Tool-specific suites in `Tools/Animation/`, `Tools/ModdingEditor/`,
`Tools/NetplayTests/` and `Tools/ModZipInstallerTests/` keep their existing locations.

## Python entry points

Audio instance acceptance uses `Tools/Tests/Modding/TestAudioRuntime.ps1` for
production Lua and owned lifetime/budget contracts with a controlled backend.
`Tools/Tests/Modding/TestAudioUnity.ps1` boots the full game in an isolated
Unity 6.6 project/profile, runs Audio Lab through native buttons and checks actual
WAV/source progression, clocks, volume/mute, global bounds and teardown. Pass the
matching editor with `-Unity`; `-ExistingFixture` requires this runner's marker
inside repository `Temp`. Fresh Windows profiles use a junction to an immutable
TAR cache inside the fixture, avoiding repeated system-drive extraction. The
runner does not delete profiles or caches. Device audibility is not tested.

```sh
python Tools/Tests/Runtime/TestAuditDECorpus.py
python Tools/Tests/Runtime/TestDEXmlAudit.py
python Tools/Tests/CharacterForms/TestCharacterForms.py
python Tools/Tests/CharacterForms/TestCharacterForms.py --case TestFormModifierTransfer
python Tools/Tests/Presentation/TestVersusTransition.py
```

The versus-transition suite checks native loading artwork ownership and the
unchanged VS completion timer for local, online, replay, training and campaign
paths with controlled Unity dependencies. It does not render the transition or
run a game playtest.

`pwsh -NoProfile -File Tools/Tests/Presentation/TestVersusPreviewNative.ps1`
uses the matching Unity editor in an isolated project with graphics enabled. It
checks the production fighter preview's animation ticks, changing pixels and
transparency across scene unloading, UI visibility and world/texture cleanup.
Fighter meshes are controlled animated quads; this is native rendering validation,
not a multiplayer game playtest.

The corpus suite uses temporary controlled inputs. Character-form checks reuse
the extracted-C# assertions from the PowerShell runners and require the matching
installed Unity editor's bundled compiler plus a .NET 10 runtime. They do not
launch Unity by default. Use `--help` for compiler paths and explicit native runs.

The four fixtures repaired during the October 1 cleanup cover transition barriers
and interpolation call order, speculative body disposal, the current node enum,
and own-animation observation in versus/title AI readiness. These use controlled
multiplayer/rendering dependencies; passing them is not rollback or Unity acceptance.

The other `Test*Native.py` scripts prepare or run isolated editor fixtures; read
their help and docstrings for required inputs and execution behavior.

## PowerShell entry points

`Combat/TestArcDartUnity.ps1` boots an isolated full-game Unity project/profile
with only Arc Dart enabled. The native HUD casts an owned launch/flight graph
through typed projectile actions: actual rig/item, rendering, travel, contact,
caster damage attribution, pause, strike removal, miss expiry and cooldown are
checked. `-ExistingFixture` accepts marked projectile/playback projects inside
repository Temp. Immutable TAR cache sharing avoids repeated system-drive data;
profiles/caches are not deleted. Controls/AI/spacing and post-tutorial state are
controlled; physical inputs, reverse facing, Eclipse mode and exports are separate.
`Combat/TestFighterPlayback.ps1` also exercises the shipped Lua graph and ability
lifecycle with controlled models. `Combat/TestScheduledMoveEvents.ps1` checks
the actual native action batch retains events raised by scheduled playback;
`Combat/TestDECombatPerksNative.ps1` covers child-owner hit/outgoing/resolved
routing in both directions, nested children and unrelated/retired roots.

`Combat/TestFighterPlayback.ps1` compiles the production Lua bindings and complete
playback/motion queues with controlled native dependencies. It checks typed owned
move handles, capability/timing/lifetime guards, competing mods, receipts,
availability, native rejection/exception isolation, recursion, pause and teardown.
The actual Active Strike source exercises HUD intent, applied/failed receipts,
cooldown and next-round reset. `Combat/TestFighterPlaybackUnity.ps1` boots a marked
isolated full game in Unity 6.6, plays the shipped authored punch through its
native HUD button and verifies animation-start notification, contact damage,
cooldown, pause retention and surrender cancellation. Controls/AI/spacing and a
post-tutorial profile are controlled. The rendered PNG is under ignored Temp.
Use `-ExistingFixture` only for a marked playback project inside repository Temp;
each run has separate logs, save identity and freshness-checked result.
Physical input, all rigs/equipment/arenas, Eclipse-mode and exports remain open.

`Combat/TestFighterMotion.ps1` compiles the production Lua binding and complete
fighter-motion queue with controlled models/session/translation. It checks typed
arguments, capability/timing/lifetime guards, independent Lua contexts, shared
limits, deferred application, pause, cancellation, failure isolation and the
shipped Repulse button/cooldown/round state.
`Combat/TestFighterMotionUnity.ps1` copies the full game assets/source into a
marked isolated Unity 6.6 project and starts real Campaign/core combat. Independent
probe mods exercise the actual callback/simulation boundary; further checks inspect
real rig points and animation data, native HUD button/cooldown, continuing combat,
pause and surrender cleanup. Input/AI are controlled; each isolated profile is
seeded with completed tutorial state before its real campaign load. First-time
onboarding is not tested.
Use `-ExistingFixture <absolute marked path inside Temp>` to reuse imported assets
while refreshing current source and mods. Each run gets a fresh save identity,
separate log and timestamp-checked acceptance result. Physical controls, every
animation/arena and exported-player behavior still need broader playtesting.


`Modding/TestModCallbackDiagnostics.ps1` exercises the actual Lua worker/session,
nested framework provider attribution, instruction-budget failures/recovery,
recording toggles, detached snapshots and bounded callback/failure histories.
`Modding/TestModCallbackDiagnosticsUnity.ps1` uses an isolated hidden Unity 6.6
editor with a rendering Game View to exercise the production overlay's native
F3/F4 Update paths, IMGUI screenshot and saved report. Scripted keys, game/session
lookup and report directory are controlled; no physical input or full-game frame
attribution is claimed. Batch mode does not present IMGUI screens.

Use PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) for managed-runtime checks. Individual scripts may also
require MSBuild, a .NET SDK, Visual Studio's compiler or a specified Unity editor.
For example, when MSBuild and the matching managed references are available:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File Tools/Tests/Progression/TestUnderworldRuntime.ps1
python Tools/Audits/AuditUnderworld.py
```

Select the runner for the subsystem you changed rather than invoking every
script. `Shared/LoadUnityManagedAssemblies.ps1` is the shared loader, not a test runner.
Some historical DE checks require downstream content or local research inputs.

`Combat/TestRoundOutcomes.ps1` executes production Lua bindings and extracts the
current `Fight` round arbitration, score, winner, end-stance and surrender methods
for a managed fixture. Models, clock, presentation and settlement are controlled.
It checks declared authority/conflicts, repeat calls, native-result precedence,
pause, stale fighter handles and round reset. It does not play native end animations,
grant game rewards or prove full-game save/settlement acceptance.
`Combat/TestRoundOutcomesUnity.ps1` runs the shipped objective with production
script sessions, native font/HUD/rendered pixels/fade teardown and extracted
current round methods in an isolated Unity 6.6 Play Mode fixture. Contacts,
models, clock, end presentation and settlement remain controlled. Both runners
share `Combat/ExportRoundOutcomeFixture.ps1`; it is an extraction helper, not a test.
Pass `-WithFocusPack` to include the actual Focus framework/add-on, separate HUD
placements, bonus behavior and a controlled static-rule contributor. This mode
also exercises extracted native adapter projection/restoration around controlled
battle source storage. It does not instantiate full native map/fight menus.

`Modding/TestModPackRules.ps1` tests additive append composition in production
Lua/script sessions: dependency/discovery order, replacements/controllers,
transaction rollback/recovery, duplicates and the aggregate rule limit. It uses
extracted current adapter apply/remove and round methods with controlled battle
storage/models, and the shipped Focus/objective save/removal/reinstallation pack.
`Modding/ExportModPackProjectionFixture.ps1` is its shared extraction helper.

`Modding/TestModExtensions.ps1` runs the production Lua runtime and script-session
lifecycle against controlled asset/combat/UI sources. It covers typed framework
services, capability/dependency/version checks, isolated data, startup rollback,
execution limits, migration restrictions and the shipped Focus framework/add-on
with saved-state reload. It does not render a native fight or perform a game playtest.

`Modding/TestModExtensionsUnity.ps1` uses the matching Unity editor with graphics
enabled in isolated Play Mode. It executes the shipped Focus pair through the
production script session, renders its production HUD view with the recovered
font, checks changing pixels and teardown, and preserves serialized state through
mod removal/reinstallation. Contacts, the asset host and unused artwork/scroll
paths are controlled. Its PNGs/XML/logs stay in `Temp/`; full-game combat,
native menu/profile integration and disk-crash acceptance remain separate.

PvP balance checks are `Combat/TestPvpBalance.ps1` (strict JSON, immutable rules,
hashing, inheritance, nonlethal chip and recovery with controlled native
dependencies) and `Combat/TestPvpHealthRuntime.ps1` (compiled recovered health
setters, pool cloning/reset, production rollback policy and state hash).
The compiled health runner and Underworld runner accept `-AssemblyDirectory`
and `-UnityManagedDirectory` overrides for the matching compiled game/editor
references. `Presentation/TestPvpHealthBarNative.ps1` renders the production
recovery component and native skew mesh in an isolated Unity project, with
controlled health and atlas-base dependencies. None is a full online playtest.

Arena region acceptance uses `Modding/TestArenaRuntime.ps1` for the production
capsule/rectangle algorithm, Lua arguments, capabilities, ownership, budgets and
complete Pulse Arena schedule with controlled native sources.
`Modding/TestArenaUnity.ps1` runs the real game through Campaign/core Tournament 3
in an isolated Unity project and post-tutorial profile. It verifies warning art,
projection, pose/contact health loss, pause/resume, recovery, shared marker limits,
scope/surrender cleanup and suppression of ticks after round-end. Input, AI and
spacing are controlled; this does not prove solid/swept physics or all arenas.

## Native validators

`Runtime/TestUnity6Workflows.ps1` uses the matching Unity 6.6 editor in an isolated
project to test input devices across Play Mode frames, modern UI modules and
native Build Profile/Multiplayer Play Mode scenario serialization. It does not
perform a full game build or multiplayer fight; see
[the workflow guide](../../Docs/Engineering/UNITY_6_WORKFLOWS.md).

`Validate*.cs` and `Verify*.cs` are fixtures invoked by their paired runners or
through an explicit Unity editor command; they are not imported into the main
project automatically. Follow the runner's instructions for fixture setup.
Managed checks and static audits do not prove native sprite import, rendering
or gameplay. Report native validation and playtests separately.
