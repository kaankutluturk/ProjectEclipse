title: Maps, opponents, fights, and rewards
description: Build a map entry, define its opponent and rules, and award the correct result.
---

A **zone** is a map page. A **battle** is a selectable entry on that page.
A **warrior** describes an opponent. A **fight** connects a battle to opponents,
rules, round settings, and rewards. Create these in that order so references exist
before you use them. See [Your first battle](../../guides/first-battle/) for a
complete connected example.

All registration and lookup functions here use `content.register` and run during
the entrypoint. Cross-mod content requires the corresponding dependency.
Tables reject unknown fields. Examples assume `local sf2 = require("sf2")`.

Some presentation fields in this part of the API still take **strings**, such as
`"my.mod:localization/battle.title"`, rather than localization handles. Respect
the field type: a handle cannot be substituted for a string.

## sf2.zones.register

Create a map page for your battles.

**Signature:** `sf2.zones.register { id, file?, start?, underworld? }`

**Requires:** `content.register`.

**When:** Entrypoint, before its battles.

**Returns:** A zone handle.

`id` is a required local ID. `file` is a string naming existing map art, default
`""`; `start` is a boolean defaulting to `false`. Reuse a known map file when
starting out; a zone ID is not the map-art filename.

`underworld` is a boolean defaulting to `false`. `true` places the page on the
**Underworld** map (the raid map the player reaches with the map's Underworld
toggle) instead of the story map, next to the game's own raid pages. An
Underworld page cannot also be the start zone. Raid map art such as `"Raid1.1"`
fits these pages. See [Underworld pages](../underworld/) for the complete flow.

```lua
local zone = sf2.zones.register { id = "training", file = "Map1.1", start = false }
local depths = sf2.zones.register { id = "depths", file = "Raid1.1", underworld = true }
```

## sf2.zones.get

Obtain an existing zone's handle instead of creating a new page.

**Signature:** `sf2.zones.get(reference)`

**Requires:** `content.register` and a dependency on an external owner.

**When:** Entrypoint.

**Returns:** A zone handle; a missing or inaccessible ID raises an error.

```lua
-- After the registration above, retrieve this mod's zone by local ID:
local same_zone = sf2.zones.get("training")
```

For another owner, use its complete `owner:zones/id` definition ID.

## sf2.battles.register

Create the map entry that the player selects to open a fight.

**Signature:** `sf2.battles.register(definition)`

**Requires:** `content.register`.

**When:** Entrypoint, after the zone.

**Returns:** A battle handle.

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | String | Required | Local battle ID. |
| `zone` | Zone handle | Required | Owning map page. |
| `type` | Battle constant/string | Required | Game battle category; start with `sf2.battles.STORY`. |
| `x`, `y` | Integers | `0` | Placement on the map page. |
| `alias`, `title`, `description` | Strings | `""` | Presentation/localization references. |
| `icon`, `icon_atlas` | Strings | `""` | Existing map-button art identifiers. |
| `preview` | Sprite handle or string | `""` | Battle-panel preview image: a sprite handle for art your mod ships, or an existing native preview name such as `preview_main.statue`. |
| `eclipse_toggle_name` | String | `""` | Eclipse-mode toggle presentation name. |
| `location` | String | `""` | Arena (location) name. |
| `music` | Audio handle or string | `""` | Fight music: a handle from [`sf2.assets.audio`](../assets/#sf2assetsaudio) for a track your mod ships, or a native track name such as `raids_vortex`. |
| `reward_image` | String | `""` | Reward presentation image reference. |
| `show_resistance` | Boolean | `false` | Whether to show resistance presentation. |
| `power_mode` | `"normal"` or `"power"` | Always shown | Underworld pages only: show the entry only while Power Mode is off (`"normal"`) or on (`"power"`). |
| `icons` | Table of sprite handles | Native button art | Your own map-button sprites; see [Map-button sprites](#map-button-sprites). |

```lua
local battle = sf2.battles.register {
    id = "training_battle", zone = zone, type = sf2.battles.STORY,
    title = "my.mod:localization/battle.title", x = 0, y = 0,
    -- Requires assets/sprites/training_preview.asset and its PNG texture.
    preview = sf2.assets.sprite("sprites/training_preview"),
}
```

### Battle preview images

The map's battle panel shows `preview` when the player selects the entry. Pass
a handle from [`sf2.assets.sprite`](../assets/#sf2assetssprite) to show your own
image; a missing or wrong-kind asset fails registration. Core battle previews
are 484 × 274 pixels, so match that size to fill the panel the same way. A
plain string is kept for compatibility and is looked up in the game's native
`UI/battles/` folder only; it is not checked when you register the battle, so a
misspelled name shows an empty panel instead of raising an error. `icon` and
`icon_atlas` select existing map-button art; use `icons` for your own.

### Map-button sprites

`icons` replaces the round map button with sprites your mod ships. It is a table
with these sprite-handle fields (from [`sf2.assets.sprite`](../assets/#sf2assetssprite)):

| Field | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base` | Required | Button while unlocked and not selected. |
| `active` | None | Button while selected. Supply it: without it the selected state has no mod art. |
| `locked` | Native lock art | Button while the battle is locked. |
| `locked_active` | None | Selected button while locked; used together with `locked`. |

Strings are rejected, and a missing or non-sprite asset fails registration.
Core map buttons are 300 × 300 pixels. Leave `icon_atlas` empty when you set
`icons`.

```lua
local boss = sf2.battles.register {
    id = "gatekeeper", zone = depths, type = sf2.battles.FINAL, x = 400, y = 900,
    -- Requires assets/sprites/buttons/gatekeeper_base.asset and _active.asset.
    icons = {
        base = sf2.assets.sprite("sprites/buttons/gatekeeper_base"),
        active = sf2.assets.sprite("sprites/buttons/gatekeeper_active"),
    },
}
```

### Power Mode entries

The Underworld map has a Power Mode checkbox. By default an entry on an
Underworld page is shown in both states. `power_mode = "normal"` shows it only
while Power Mode is off; `"power"` only while it is on. Pair a normal boss with a
harder variant at the same position to make the checkbox swap them. The field is
rejected on story pages; omit it for entries that should always be visible.

```lua
local normal = sf2.battles.register { id = "boss_1", zone = depths, type = sf2.battles.FINAL, power_mode = "normal" }
local power = sf2.battles.register { id = "boss_1_power", zone = depths, type = sf2.battles.FINAL, power_mode = "power" }
```

Constants on `sf2.battles` are `DUMMY`, `TUTORIAL`, `CHALLENGE`, `BOSSES`,
`TOURNAMENT`, `STORY`, `SURVIVAL`, `FRIENDLY`, `AUTO`, `AI`, `HIDDEN`, `FAKE`,
`PVP`, `FINAL`, and `FINAL_TITAN`. The string `"raid"` is also accepted for
registered offline raids. A category constant does not implement an online
service or arbitrary game mode; use the supported offline mode APIs.

Create a fight for the battle and reveal it through a quest or `sf2.battles.reveal`. Merely registering
an entry does not guarantee that an existing story save will display it.

To pair a normal battle with an Eclipse variant, register both in the same zone.
Set only the normal entry's `eclipse_toggle_name` to the variant's full runtime
name: for an owned battle with local ID `training_eclipse`, that is
`sf2.mod.id .. ":battles/training_eclipse"`. This string is not a localization key.
Give each entry its own fights; the field does not create the variant or copy
opponents and rewards. The native mode-update action resolves the name within
that zone, so a missing or misspelled target cannot switch.

A revealed but locked normal entry remains visible and locked in either mode.
The native mode update does not introduce its Eclipse counterpart and hides a
counterpart already present in an older save. Once the normal entry is unlocked,
the next mode update can introduce/show the variant. Existing variant locks and
fight history are preserved. These checks run at native mode-update boundaries,
not as a general rule for custom encounter-launch code.

## sf2.battles.patch

Move an existing battle's button on its map page.

**Signature:** `sf2.battles.patch { target, x?, y? }`

**Returns:** `nil`.

**When:** Entrypoint, after the target's owner has committed its definitions.
Core battles are always committed first.

**Requires:** `content.patch` and a dependency on the target's owner (for example
`core`).

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `target` | String | Required | Qualified battle ID, such as `core:battles/zone_6/duel`. |
| `x` | Integer, −10,000–10,000 | Keep current | New horizontal map position. |
| `y` | Integer, −10,000–10,000 | Keep current | New vertical map position. |

Supply `x`, `y` or both. The coordinates use the same map-page space as
[`sf2.battles.register`](#sf2battlesregister): positive `x` is right, positive
`y` is up. Only the placement changes. The battle keeps its identity, type,
fights, art, lock state and saved progress, so existing saves are unaffected.

Core battle IDs follow `core:battles/<zone>/<battle>`, with the zone and battle
names from `stages.xml` in lower case. Each Eclipse-mode or intermission twin is
a separate battle; move it too if it shares the spot, as with Act 6's Duel below.

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
-- Declare content.patch and a dependency on core in mod.toml.
-- Act 6's Duel normally sits at (-370, 50); move it and its intermission twin.
sf2.battles.patch { target = "core:battles/zone_6/duel", x = -300, y = 100 }
sf2.battles.patch { target = "core:battles/zone_6/duel_intermission", x = -300, y = 100 }
```

Limits and errors:

- Place your own battles with `x` and `y` in `sf2.battles.register`. Patching
  a battle registered by your own mod is an error.
- One mod may patch a battle's placement once. A second mod that patches the same
  battle is rejected as a conflict, and its registration rolls back.
- Unknown targets, non-battle IDs, missing `x` and `y`, non-integer or
  out-of-range coordinates and any other field raise an error.
- The placement is part of the saved content fingerprint. Disabling the mod and
  restarting restores the original position.

Registration, conflicts, rollback and fingerprinting have automated tests. The
native map applies the new position when the game loads its stages; this has
been compiled but not yet checked on the in-game map.

## sf2.battles.set_locked

Change the saved lock of a revealed battle owned by this mod.

**Signature:** `sf2.battles.set_locked(battle, locked)`

**Returns:** `true` when applied or already in the requested state. `false` when
the profile/map is unavailable, native input is blocked, a transition or encounter
preparation is pending, or the battle has no saved revealed entry.

**When:** On an initialized map, such as a normal UI `on_click` callback after
story presentation. Calls during UI `on_close` cleanup raise an error; cleanup may
run because the scene/profile is being replaced. Do not retry in a tight loop.

**Requires:** `story.progression`, this script's own battle handle and a boolean
`locked`. Strings, forged handles, core battles and other mods' battles are not
accepted. Register entries first, then reveal them before changing locks.

```lua
-- battle was registered by this mod. In a normal map UI button callback:
if sf2.battles.set_locked(battle, false) then
    sf2.ui.close(view) -- also requires ui.create
end
```

This changes only the native saved lock flag, refreshes map presentation and
requests a normal profile save. It does not reveal a missing entry, change hidden
state, reset replay counts or clear fight history. Unlocking does not override
other native fight conditions. Repeating the same value is harmless. A return
value is not a guarantee that a disk write has completed. Use declared mod state
for your own notification flags, and mark them only after accepting the change.

## sf2.battles.reveal

Create the saved map entry for a battle owned by this mod, then refresh the map.

**Signature:** `sf2.battles.reveal(battle, locked)`

**Returns:** `true` when the entry exists or was created; `false` when the profile,
map or native battle is unavailable, input is blocked, or a transition, encounter
preparation or settlement prevents progression.

**When:** On an initialized map, usually from an ordinary UI `on_click` after
story presentation. UI `on_close` cleanup calls raise an error. Do not retry in
a tight loop. Several reveals may be followed by a focus in the same callback.

**Requires:** `story.progression`, this script's own registered battle handle,
and a strict boolean `locked`. Strings, foreign/core handles and forged handles
are rejected. Register the battle's fights during loading.

```lua
-- Inside a normal map callback, using a battle registered during loading:
if sf2.battles.reveal(battle, true) then
    -- Later progression can call sf2.battles.set_locked(battle, false).
end
```

`locked` is the initial value for a new entry only. Repeating a reveal preserves
an existing lock, hidden flag, replay count and fight history. It can restore the
entry's native visibility, but never overrides an existing hidden flag or the
current story/raid map mode. A new entry is not hidden and starts at replay count
zero. Reveal neither starts a fight nor bypasses its conditions. The host requests
a normal save when it changes the entry; success does not guarantee completed disk
I/O. This operation is idempotent, not an atomic transaction across several battles.

## sf2.battles.focus

Select an owned battle already represented on the current map.

**Signature:** `sf2.battles.focus(battle)`

**Returns:** `true` when focus is applied; `false` when the entry is absent,
hidden, outside the current map mode, or blocked by the same lifecycle/input
guards as reveal.

**When:** On an initialized map, including after reveal in the same UI callback.
Calls from UI `on_close` cleanup raise an error.

**Requires:** `story.progression` and this script's own battle handle.

```lua
if sf2.battles.set_locked(battle, false) then
    if sf2.battles.focus(battle) then
        -- The caller can now record its own notification-completed flag.
    end
end
```

Focus uses immediate native map selection, updates the relevant story/raid saved
focus, and requests a normal save. Locked visible entries may be focused. It does
not reveal entries, change lock/hidden state, switch map modes, or start combat.
Native selection can subsequently choose a fight within that battle. The API
does not guarantee that the save is already durable on disk.

## sf2.warriors.get_template

Get an existing opponent template as the starting point for a new warrior.

**Signature:** `sf2.warriors.get_template(reference)`

**Requires:** `content.register` and the template owner's dependency.

**When:** Entrypoint.

**Returns:** A warrior-template handle; missing IDs raise errors.

```lua
local template = sf2.warriors.get_template("core:warrior-templates/default")
```

Template handles differ from warrior handles; pass this one to the `template`
field of `sf2.warriors.register` or `sf2.warriors.register_template`.

A template lookup requires a definition already present in the catalog. Naming a
missing template does not restore its skeleton, inherited equipment, voice or
other native settings. For reusable opponent modules, pass verified template and
item handles into a registration function and check its required inputs before
registering variants. Leave incomplete modules outside the entrypoint until their
dependencies are available. A successful comparison of projected loadout fields
does not establish that the inherited template or equipment works in combat.

## sf2.warriors.register_template

Define your own opponent template: shared settings that several warriors inherit.

**Signature:** `sf2.warriors.register_template(definition)`

**Requires:** `content.register`.

**When:** Entrypoint, before the warriors that use it.

**Returns:** A warrior-template handle, accepted wherever `sf2.warriors.get_template`
handles are.

The table takes the same fields as [`sf2.warriors.register`](#sf2warriorsregister)
except `group`, `random`, `body_model` and `skin_models`: `id`, `template`,
`first_name`, `last_name`, `avatar`, `voice`, `level`, `tactic`, `attributes`,
`attribute_alignments`, `items`, `perks`, `health_bars` and `skeleton`. `template`
names a parent template (core or one of yours registered earlier), so templates
can form a chain.

```lua
local default = sf2.warriors.get_template("core:warrior-templates/default")
local boss = sf2.warriors.register_template {
    id = "fire_boss", template = default,
    first_name = "my.mod:localization/fire_boss.name", voice = "Male",
    health_bars = 15, attributes = { ShieldStack = 15 },
    items = { sf2.items.get("core:items/weapon/WEAPON_KATANA") },
    skeleton = "SkeletonHeavy",
}
local fighter = sf2.warriors.register { id = "fire_boss_1", template = boss, level = 40 }
```

The game merges inheritance field by field, with one exception: a template's
**item list replaces** its parent's list instead of adding to it. A template that
sets `items` must therefore list everything its warriors wear, including the
body; set `skeleton` as well so the body is not lost. Warriors that set their own
`items` replace the template's list in the same way. Templates are part of the
saved content fingerprint. `attribute_alignments` rows are additive: a child
template or warrior retains inherited rows and appends only the rows it declares.
For example, a parent with seven rows and a warrior with two rows gives that
warrior nine rows. Omit the field to inherit the parent's rows as they are.

## sf2.warriors.register

Define a character, optionally inheriting from a core template. Use its handle
for an opponent, an independent actor or an owned fight's `player_character`.

**Signature:** `sf2.warriors.register(definition)`

**Requires:** `content.register`.

**When:** Entrypoint, before registering the fight.

**Returns:** A warrior handle.

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | String | Required | Local warrior ID. |
| `template` | Warrior-template handle | Omitted | Template to inherit from. |
| `first_name`, `last_name` | Strings | `""` | Name/localization references. |
| `avatar` | Sprite handle or string | `""` | Opponent portrait: a sprite handle for art your mod ships, or an existing native portrait name. |
| `voice` | String | `""` | Existing voice identifier. |
| `level` | Integer | `0` | Opponent level setting, 0–10,000; use an explicit level in a new opponent. |
| `tactic` | Tactic handle or string | `""` | Registered tactic or existing tactic name. |
| `group` | String | `""` | Opponent content group. |
| `random` | Integer | `0` | Native random-selection setting. |
| `items` | Item-handle array | Empty | Equipment/content loadout. |
| `perks` | Array of perk handles or settings rows | Empty | Up to 64 active opponent perks; see below. |
| `attributes` | Name-to-number table | Empty | Finite native attribute values. |
| `attribute_alignments` | Alignment array | Empty | Rows described below. |
| `body_model` | Model handle | Inherit skeleton | Native body model, including its ordered point rig. |
| `skin_models` | Model handle array | Empty | Up to 16 native geometry overlays, appended after equipment. A warrior with skins is also offered as a look for Shadow in **Mods > Characters**; see [Replace Shadow's look](../../guides/character-authoring/#replace-shadows-look). |
| `health_bars` | Integer | `0` | Additional health-pool configuration; `0` keeps the template setting; `1` explicitly selects one pool. |
| `skeleton` | String | Inherit | Native body item such as `"Skeleton"` or `"SkeletonHeavy"`, added to the loadout. |

Mod-authored `body_model` and `skin_models` receive a geometry preflight when
the game loads the fighter. Unresolved points/edges, duplicate composed node or
edge names, invalid helper definitions and unsafe numeric values reject before
native geometry parsing, with a model/element/field diagnostic. Core handles keep
legacy compatibility. See the [geometry rules](../../guides/character-authoring/#geometry-checks-when-the-game-loads-your-character)
for defaults, limits and composition order. A valid model handle alone does not
prove animation or collision compatibility.

```lua
local opponent = sf2.warriors.register {
    id = "sparring_partner",
    template = sf2.warriors.get_template("core:warrior-templates/default"),
    first_name = "my.mod:localization/opponent.name",
    level = 1,
    tactic = "Standard",
    -- Requires assets/sprites/partner.asset; core uses 512 x 512 portraits.
    avatar = sf2.assets.sprite("sprites/partner"),
}
```

The avatar appears on the versus screen and fight HUD. A sprite handle is
validated at registration and keeps working with any mod namespace. A plain
string such as `"character_savage"` names a portrait in the game's native
`UI/Users/` folder and is not validated. Core sprite handles also work, for
example `sf2.assets.sprite("core:ui/users/character_savage")`, but only for
portraits present in the packaged core art catalog.

Alignment rows require numeric `factor` and `shift`; optional `priority` defaults
to `0` and `mode` to `"all"` (`"normal"` and `"eclipse"` are also accepted).
Use documented native attributes for the relevant content; adding a made-up
attribute name does not create a new mechanic. Template inheritance and native
attribute handling can affect the result, so test custom balance in a fight.

Each `perks` entry can be a handle or `{ perk = handle, aspect = number,
chance_factor = number, chance = number, frames = integer, parameters = table }`. You may mix these forms in a dense array. Settings
apply only to that warrior's **core** perk instance; they do not change the core
definition or other opponents. Configure owned Lua perks through their behavior
definitions instead. Duplicate perks are rejected even when their settings differ.

All settings are optional. `aspect` accepts finite numbers from 0 to
2,147,483,647. `chance_factor` accepts finite numbers from 0 to 10,000; it is a
native multiplier, **not** a 0–1 probability or guaranteed activation rate.
`chance` is a finite probability from 0 to 1. `frames` is an integer duration from
0 to 2,147,483,647 in native simulation frames; it is not a wall-clock timeout.
These override the native perk's `Chance` and `Frames` parameters only where that
perk uses them. They do not bypass the perk's other activation conditions or
change a perk that does not consume those parameters.
Their effects depend on the selected native perk. Omitted fields inherit its
defaults; explicit zero overrides a default. Changes to any setting change
the saved content fingerprint. A bare handle and `{ perk = handle }` are equivalent.

`parameters` sets any other native parameter the perk reads, as a table of up to
32 names mapped to finite numbers within ±1,000,000,000, for example
`{ DamageFactor = 0.5, Health = 2 }`. Names start with a letter and use at most
64 letters, digits or underscores. The dedicated names (`Aspect`, `Chance`,
`ChanceFactor`, `Frames`, `Name`, `Level`, `ApplyTo`, `Eclipse`, `Round`) are
rejected here; use the fields above. A name the perk does not read has no effect,
so check the perk's native parameters before relying on one.

```lua
local opponent = sf2.warriors.register {
    id = "enchanted_partner",
    template = sf2.warriors.get_template("core:warrior-templates/default"),
    level = 1,
    tactic = "Standard",
    perks = {
        {
            perk = sf2.perks.get("core:perks/PERK_ITEM_SPECIAL_TIME_BOMB_WEAPON"),
            aspect = 100000,
            chance_factor = 2.69,
        },
        {
            perk = sf2.perks.get("core:perks/PERK_ITEM_SPECIAL_ENFEEBLE_RANGED"),
            aspect = 100000,
            chance = 0.26,
        },
        { perk = sf2.perks.get("core:perks/PERK_HERMITSTORM"), frames = 300 },
    },
}
```

For a Blender import, animation bake, geometric skin export and playable move example, follow [Character authoring](../../guides/character-authoring/). Body and skin assets must satisfy the native point-rig contract; these fields do not load arbitrary FBX files. The warrior handle also scopes moves through a `character` condition. Changing model bindings changes the saved content fingerprint.

`skeleton` names one of the game's recovered body items: a name starting with
`Skeleton` or `SKELETON_`, at most 64 letters, digits or underscores. It is
written into the loadout like an item, so it matters mainly when `items` replaces
an inherited list (see [`sf2.warriors.register_template`](#sf2warriorsregister_template)).
It is not a model handle; use `body_model` for authored bodies.

`health_bars` is bounded to 0–10,000. Zero inherits the template; 1 means one pool. Values above 1 set the **total** number of
bars, including the active bar. These are separate from temporary Lua damage
shields. Duplicate loadout items or perks are rejected.

## sf2.rewards.register

Create a reward that a fight can grant through its normal result/save flow.

**Signature:** `sf2.rewards.register { id, items?, choices?, gems?, experience?, prize_base?, currencies? }`

**Requires:** `content.register`.

**When:** Entrypoint, before the fight uses the reward.

**Returns:** A reward handle.

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | String | Required | Local reward ID. |
| `items` | Grant array | Empty | Guaranteed item grants: `{ item = handle, upgrade = 0, configure? = function }`. |
| `choices` | Choice-group array | Empty | Each group has `items`, a weighted candidate array. |
| `gems` | Integer, 0–1,000,000 | `0` | Fixed gem reward through normal acquisition. |
| `experience` | Integer, 0–1,000,000 | `0` | Experience points added by normal fight-result processing. |
| `prize_base` | Finite number, 0–1,000,000 | Omitted | Native performance-bonus base, explained below. |
| `currencies` | Array of drop rows | Empty | Forge-material drops, explained below. |

`experience` is an absolute point count, not a level or percentage. Registering a
reward does not grant it: the fight's selected reward slot must reach the normal
result/settlement flow. Native level caps and experience processing still apply.

`prize_base` supplies the native base used to calculate performance coin bonuses
(such as critical hits and fighting style). It is **not** a fixed coin award.
The native reward parser applies the encounter's prize denomination scale. The
result calculation then uses the base with its usual performance coefficients.
Omitting the field preserves native fallback selection. A positive value selects
this reward's base; zero is preserved but still follows native fallback rules
and does not guarantee zero coin bonuses. The API does not modify global reward
coefficients or bypass settlement. Changing either field changes the saved
content fingerprint; explicit zero experience is equivalent to omission.

```lua
local victory = sf2.rewards.register {
    id = "story_victory", experience = 2, gems = 8, prize_base = 1,
}
-- Use victory in the appropriate wins slot of sf2.fights.register.rewards.
```

`currencies` adds forge-material drops, the materials used by the forge. Each
row is `{ currency, expected, show? }`: `currency` is `"ForgeMaterial1"`,
`"ForgeMaterial2"` or `"ForgeMaterial3"`; `expected` is the finite average amount,
greater than 0 and at most 10,000,000, from which the game rolls the drop; `show`
defaults to `true` and controls whether the result screen lists it. A reward
holds at most 16 rows and each currency at most once.

```lua
local boss_reward = sf2.rewards.register {
    id = "boss_victory", gems = 17,
    currencies = {
        { currency = "ForgeMaterial1", expected = 50 },
        { currency = "ForgeMaterial3", expected = 9, show = false },
    },
}
```

A candidate row is `{ item = handle, upgrade = 0, weight = 1, configure = function(context) ... end }`. Upgrade is a
nonnegative integer. Weights must be finite and greater than zero. Each group
selects an item from its candidates. This is a content reward, not arbitrary
script access to a currency balance.

### Grant-time equipment configuration

Equipment grants may include `configure`, a bounded Lua callback evaluated when
the host composes that reward result. It is available on both direct `items` and
weighted choice candidates. Consumable, free and seal grants cannot use it.

```lua
local precision = sf2.perks.get("core:perks/PERK_ITEM_SPECIAL_PRECISION_WEAPON")

local titan_reward = sf2.rewards.register {
    id = "titan_reward",
    items = {
        {
            item = desolator,
            configure = function(context)
                return {
                    level = context.player_level,
                    enchantments = {
                        { perk = precision, aspect = 1940.5, chance = 0.2,
                          parameters = { DamageFactor = 10000 } },
                    },
                }
            end,
        },
    },
}
```

The callback receives a fresh calculation snapshot:

| Context field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `player_level` | Integer | Player level captured before reward XP is applied. |
| `item_id` | String | Qualified ID of the item being granted. |

Return a table with either or both of these optional fields:

| Result field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `level` | Integer, 1–10,000 | Equipment level for this grant snapshot. Defaults to `context.player_level`. |
| `enchantments` | Dense array, at most 64 entries | Grant-time enchantments. Each entry has a `perk` handle and optional settings below. Duplicate perk IDs are rejected. |

Each enchantment entry accepts `aspect` (finite `0..2147483647`),
`chance_factor` (finite `0..10000`), `chance` (finite `0..1`), `frames`
(nonnegative integer), and `parameters` (up to 32 named native numeric `Set`
attributes, each finite and within ±1 billion). Names must be 1–64 letters,
digits or underscores, starting with a letter; the dedicated setting names
cannot appear in `parameters`. The native perk must actually read a named
parameter for it to have an effect. Omitted settings stay omitted in the saved
perk rather than receiving synthetic defaults. Perk handles must already have
been looked up or registered during mod
registration and captured by the callback. An explicit empty `enchantments = {}`
adds no grant-time enchantments and still preserves the item's normal acquisition
defaults. Omitting `enchantments` also preserves those defaults. The existing
`upgrade` field remains a separate nonnegative ordinal and is not derived from the
returned `level`.

The selected level must exist in that item's native progression. An unavailable
level skips the configured grant with a diagnostic instead of lowering its level.

The callback is a calculation hook, not a general event handler. It runs with a
200,000-instruction budget and may also run for previews, so it must return the
same result for the same context. Do not retain or mutate the context, mutate Lua
captured state, or depend on call count. Capability-backed `sf2` operations are
blocked while the callback is running, so profile/state access, UI, navigation,
content mutation and similar operations are unavailable. Logging remains allowed.
The pure asset identity/existence helpers `sf2.assets.qualify` and
`sf2.assets.exists` also remain available because they do not pass through the
capability gate. Prefer captured handles plus ordinary Lua math for the result.

The host evaluates configuration after owned/missing-item filtering and makes a
fresh native grant copy for the result. A thrown error, invalid return value,
instruction-budget failure or disposed callback skips that item and reports a
diagnostic. Other reward items and base currencies remain intact. The host does
not silently fall back to the unconfigured item. Successful configuration then
continues through the existing settlement and save path.

This is typed grant configuration only. It does not expose raw XML, expression
strings or arbitrary item metadata. Static editor checks validate the callback
shape and handles; they do not establish runtime rendering or art correctness.

Legacy XML reward items also support `UpgradeLevel`, which is an encoded native
upgrade level rather than the ordinal `UpgradeNumber` used by Lua's `upgrade`.
For example, `UpgradeLevel="?Player[].Level*100"` evaluates through the native
player-level expression resolver when the reward is selected. Selection uses the
native quest-grant lookup: the first upgrade entry whose encoded level is at
least the requested value. Negative values and unavailable upgrades fail reward
selection; specifying both upgrade attributes fails parsing. Existing
`UpgradeNumber` selection and clamping are unchanged. This compatibility support
does not expose XML expressions through the Lua API or provide a complete
interactive lottery workflow.

```lua
local no_reward = sf2.rewards.register { id = "no_reward" }
local victory_reward = sf2.rewards.register { id = "victory_reward", gems = 5 }
```

## sf2.fights.register

Connect a battle to characters, rounds, rules, and rewards.

**Signature:** `sf2.fights.register(definition)`

**Requires:** `content.register`.

**When:** Entrypoint, after the referenced definitions.

**Returns:** A fight handle.

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | String | Required | Local fight ID. |
| `battle` | Battle handle | Required | Map entry this fight belongs to. |
| `warriors` | Warrior-handle array | Empty | Opponent definitions. |
| `player_character` | Warrior handle | Omitted | Optional temporary player character for this owned fight. Omit to use the saved player's normal combat setup. |
| `rules` | Rule-handle array | Empty | Fight rules from `sf2.rules`. |
| `rewards` | Reward-handle array | Empty | Reward slots indexed by wins; see below. |
| `rounds` | Integer, 1–100 | `3` | Number of rounds. |
| `round_time` | Integer, 1–86400 | `99` | Time limit in seconds. |
| `replays`, `replay_interval`, `power` | Nonnegative integers | `0` | Native replay, interval, and power settings. |
| `location` | String | `""` | Arena name. |
| `music` | Audio handle or string | `""` | Fight music reference: an audio handle from `sf2.assets.audio` or a native track name. |
| `evaluated_rating` | Finite number | `-1` | Native rating setting. |
| `health_recovery` | Finite nonnegative number | `1` | Native health recovery setting. |
| `description`, `reward_image` | Strings | `""` | Presentation references. |
| `locked` | Boolean | `false` | Initial lock setting. |

`player_character` chooses the player at encounter creation, including its body,
skins, level, attributes, equipment, perks, name and portrait. The fighter owns
the native player slot and normal controls; its tactic does not turn it into an
AI player. This is temporary combat content and does not equip items or replace
the saved profile's character. Native round rules still apply. Use an explicit
character level and a compatible rig/move set. A referenced character must be
registered and accessible when the content transaction commits.

This field belongs to owned `sf2.fights.register` definitions. It is not a
`sf2.fights.patch` field or a general profile/loadout selection operation. A mode
using the fight, including a generated encounter based on it, keeps this declared
player character unless its [prepared encounter plan](../events-and-modes/#on_prepare)
supplies an owned `player_character` override. Use `fighter:change_form` for a
later in-fight transition.

```lua
local fight = sf2.fights.register {
    id = "training_fight", battle = battle,
    rounds = 1, round_time = 99,
    location = sf2.locations.name(arena), -- arena: registered location handle
    warriors = { opponent },
    rewards = { no_reward, victory_reward },
}
```

To start this owned encounter as a different playable character, register it
before the fight and add `player_character = hero` to that fight table:

```lua
local hero = sf2.warriors.register {
    id = "training_hero", level = 3,
    template = sf2.warriors.get_template("core:warrior-templates/man_kungfu"),
}
-- In the existing sf2.fights.register table: player_character = hero
```

For a complete playable body, skin and character-specific Punch example, see
[Authored Fighter Lab](../../guides/character-authoring/#verify-in-a-fight).

**Reward order matters.** The first Lua element is the zero-win result slot.
For a one-round fight, use `{ no_reward, victory_reward }` so a loss does not
accidentally receive the victory reward. Do not grant the same item again in a
fight-end quest unless you intend a second reward.

For scheduled or replayable content, use [events and modes](../events-and-modes/)
to manage sequence progress and entry requirements.

## sf2.fights.patch

Replace supported fields on an existing registered fight.

**Signature:** `sf2.fights.patch { target, description?, rounds?, round_time?, location?, music?, warriors?, reward_drops?, rules?, append_rules? }`

**Requires:** `content.patch`, and a dependency on the target owner.

**When:** Entrypoint, after the target mod has committed its definitions.

**Returns:** `nil`.

`target` is a fight definition ID string. Supply at least one changed field.
`description` is a string; `rounds` is 1–100; `round_time` is 1–86400 seconds.
`location` accepts a nonempty recovered runtime name. For a registered custom
location, use `sf2.locations.name(location)`. `music` accepts an audio handle
from `sf2.assets.audio` for a mod-owned track, or a nonempty native track name.
An audio handle checks that the packaged asset exists when the mod loads;
a native name is resolved by the game when the encounter starts. These fields
change the encounter's presentation without changing its identity or progress.

Use `append_rules = { rule, ... }` to keep existing rules and add your own in
array order. Use `rules = { rule, ... }` to replace the entire rule list, including
native rules on a core encounter. `rules = {}` explicitly clears it; an empty
`append_rules` is rejected. The two forms are mutually exclusive, accept at most
100 registered rule handles (also bounded to 100 after appending), and reject
duplicate handles. Handles may be registered earlier in this same entrypoint.
Both static rules and [Lua behavior rules](../rules/#sf2rulesbehavior) are supported.

`warriors = { opponent, ... }` replaces the entire opponent list.
Supply 1–100 unique registered warrior handles, in encounter order. An empty list
is rejected. These are warrior handles, not warrior-template handles or string IDs;
you may register them earlier in the same entrypoint. Omitting `warriors` preserves
the existing opponents. This field uses the normal warrior authoring contract,
including templates, equipment and custom character models.

```lua
-- opponent is a handle returned by sf2.warriors.register earlier in this script.
sf2.fights.patch {
    target = "core:fights/zone_1/boss_lynx/1",
    warriors = { opponent },
}
```

Opponent replacement leaves encounter identity, rewards and saved campaign
progress intact; it does not unlock or reset the fight. Two patches replacing
the same fight's opponents conflict. Opponent order contributes to the content
fingerprint. Full-game opponent presentation and campaign replay acceptance
remain pending; automated checks cover Lua registration, conflicts, preservation
of other fields and native XML projection.

Appending preserves native XML rules that have no public handle. Their native
execution remains unchanged; Lua rules run through the documented combat callback
dispatcher. Array order orders Lua rules relative to other Lua rules, not native
engine actions across different callback stages.
The target must already exist in the exposed catalog: this is not an arbitrary
XML patch and not a setter for a newly staged fight in the same transaction.

```lua
-- Replace the owner and ID with an existing fight from a declared dependency.
sf2.fights.patch {
    target = "other.mod:fights/trial",
    round_time = 120,
}
```

Competing changes to the same semantic field conflict. Different supported
fields can coexist. Unsupported fields, missing targets, or undeclared owners
fail registration.

Fight fields from one call are staged together: a validation failure discards
that call's fields, preserving earlier successful calls. A conflict discovered
when committing the mod still rejects the entire registration transaction.
The current Lua sandbox does not provide `pcall`/`xpcall`; an entrypoint error
aborts loading rather than letting the script recover and continue.

`append_rules` from different mods compose in dependency load order, preserving
each list's order. Native XML projection preserves recovered entries first and
then adds the combined static rules once. Lua behavior rules use the combined
handle order at their existing combat dispatch boundary; they are not XML entries.
Dependencies load before their dependents; among currently ready mods, IDs sort
with an ordinal, case-sensitive comparison. Folder/discovery order is irrelevant.
Lua rule callbacks use that combined order; order-dependent effects are not
automatically commutative.

`rules` remains an exclusive replacement: it conflicts with any other rule-list
patch, and later appends cannot add to its replacement. Diagnostics name the
incoming mod and existing contributors. A mod can patch a fight's rule field
once per registration transaction. Duplicate attached handles, more than 100
combined handles, and overlapping [round controllers](../round-outcomes/) still
reject the entire registering transaction, including unrelated fields and
definitions. Later independent compatible mods can continue loading.

Encounter IDs and saved campaign
progress are preserved. The patch is reapplied from base definitions at startup;
disabling the mod and restarting restores base content. Content fingerprints
distinguish appended rules from replacement, including an empty replacement.
Append records now identify their operation as append; older profiles using
these patches can therefore report a changed content fingerprint after upgrading.
State IDs and schemas are unchanged by this feature.
See [Combine mods](../../guides/combine-mods/) for the tested three-mod example
and removal/reinstallation limits.

```lua
local guard = sf2.rules.behavior { id = "guard", behavior = my_behavior }
sf2.fights.patch {
    target = "core:fights/zone_1/boss_lynx/1",
    append_rules = { guard },
    location = "dojo",
    music = "fight1_samurai_spirit",
}
```

To supply music from the mod's `assets/audio/boss_theme.wav`, patch with a
handle instead:

```lua
local boss_theme = sf2.assets.audio("audio/boss_theme")
sf2.fights.patch {
    target = "core:fights/zone_1/boss_lynx/1",
    music = boss_theme,
}
```

`my_behavior` above must be a registered behavior handle. The complete
`Mods/example.core-fight` mod demonstrates a health-dependent guard on an existing
campaign opponent. These fields do not provide a generic XML patch interface or
economy overrides. Reward editing is limited to the item-drop scopes below.


### Editing encounter item drops

`reward_drops` accepts 1–100 scoped edits. Each edit replaces the
selected scope's direct item grants and item-only weighted choices. It does not
replace the entire native reward row.

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `wins` | Integer | Required | Existing zero-based reward slot, 0–100. Slot 0 is the zero-win result; slot 1 is one win. The slot must exist on the target fight. |
| `reward` | Reward handle | Required | Registered reward supplying the replacement items/choices. Its `gems` must be zero. An empty reward clears direct drops. |
| `mode` | `"all"`, `"normal"`, `"eclipse"` | `"all"` | Select the shared row or a mode-specific addition. |
| `min_level` | Integer | Omitted | Inclusive lower player-level bound, 1–10,000. |
| `max_level` | Integer | Omitted | Inclusive upper player-level bound, 1–10,000; must be at least the minimum. |

With neither level bound, only the selected scope's direct drops change. With
one or both bounds, the edit selects a native level row with exactly those bounds,
creating it when absent. Omitted bounds stay unbounded. Other level rows remain
unchanged, including overlapping ranges: native settlement adds every matching
row. Duplicate matching scopes are rejected as ambiguous.

**Modes are additive.** `"all"` edits the shared reward, which applies in both
modes. `"eclipse"` edits only the extra Eclipse reward; shared items still apply.
A missing mode scope is created within the existing result slot.

A mode scope does not select a different battle. Some vanilla encounters use a
separate Eclipse battle through `EclipseToggleName`. Lynx, for example, links
`BOSS_LYNX` to `BOSS_LYNX_ECLIPSEMODE`: target the latter for the replay encounter,
as below. Patching one fight does not automatically patch its linked counterpart.

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
local prize = sf2.rewards.register {
    id = "eclipse_prize",
    items = {{ item = sf2.items.get("core:items/weapon/WEAPON_C2_Z2_MONK_KATAR") }},
}
sf2.fights.patch {
    target = "core:fights/zone_1/boss_lynx_eclipsemode/1",
    reward_drops = {{ wins = 1, mode = "eclipse", reward = prize }},
}
```

The example requires `content.register` and `content.patch`, plus
a dependency on `core`. It changes a reward definition, not completion conditions:
it does not unlock the fight, reset progress or make an item a one-time grant.
Native repeat/reward settlement rules still apply. The native result handler skips
equipment the profile already owns; test with an unowned item or a separate test
profile. Mod-owned consumables retain their supported repeat-grant behavior.

Money, premium currency, experience, reward scaling, lotteries, resistance and
other scopes are preserved. A choice containing non-item outcomes is rejected:
changing its item weights would also change currency probabilities. This operation
does not edit lottery contents. Nested equipment configuration is available only
through the reward grant's typed `configure` callback described above, rather than
through arbitrary metadata or XML edits.

Edits to the same fight/result/mode/exact-level scope conflict, including repeated
edits by one mod. Distinct scopes coexist. All edits in one call share its rollback
boundary. Content fingerprints include the scopes and reward identities; disabling
the mod and restarting rebuilds the original definitions.

Lua registration, scoped projection and rollback have automated coverage. A native
fixture also exercises the production item builders, item parser, weighted choice,
mode/level reward composition, repeated evaluation and native result item selection,
with controlled profile, inventory lookup, item upgrade and numeric services. It verifies preserved currency values, item upgrade/drop flags
and independent lottery slot lists. Full-game reward display, inventory granting,
replay eligibility and save/reload acceptance remain pending; these fixtures alone
do not establish DE reward parity.
