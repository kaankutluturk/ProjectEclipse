title: Item sets, perk choices, and forging
description: Group equipment into sets, change perk choices, and register enchantment recipes.
---

These functions run in your entry script. Declare a dependency on `core` when using its items, perks, or forge profiles. A *handle* is the Lua value returned by a lookup or registration function; pass that value directly instead of its name.

## sf2.itemsets.register

**Signature:** `sf2.itemsets.register(definition)`

**Returns:** An item-set handle.

**When:** During mod loading.

**Requires:** `content.register`.

Groups items into a named set. It does not automatically add a set bonus or grant the items to the player.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Required local identifier, such as `training_set`. |
| `title`, `text`, `brief` | Required localization handles from `sf2.localization.key`. |
| `members` | Required, nonempty array of member tables. |

Each member requires an item handle in `item`. Optional presentation fields are `scale` (default `1`), `rotate`, `x`, `y`, and `icons_y` (all default `0`). Values must be finite numbers. Each item can appear only once in this set.

```lua
local katana = sf2.items.get("core:items/weapon/weapon_katana")
local set = sf2.itemsets.register {
    id = "training_set",
    title = sf2.localization.key("set.title"),
    text = sf2.localization.key("set.description"),
    brief = sf2.localization.key("set.brief"),
    members = { { item = katana, scale = 1 } },
}
```

Add the three localization keys to your mod's language file. Registering a set does not create a shop listing; use the shop API for items you want players to buy.

## sf2.progression.replace_perk_branch

**Signature:** `sf2.progression.replace_perk_branch(definition)`

**Returns:** Nothing (`nil`).

**When:** During mod loading, before the perk tree is used.

**Requires:** `content.patch`; looking up or registering perks also requires `content.register`.

Replaces the available choices at one perk-tree level. It does not immediately teach a perk, add experience, or change upgrade prices. Two mods replacing the same level conflict.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `level` | Required integer from `1` to `52`. |
| `entries` | Required, nonempty array of perk choices. |
| `entries[].perk` | Required perk handle. |
| `entries[].action` | `"unlock"` (default) or `"upgrade"`. |

```lua
-- opening_focus is a perk handle registered earlier in this script.
sf2.progression.replace_perk_branch {
    level = 2,
    entries = { { perk = opening_focus, action = "unlock" } },
}
```

An `upgrade` entry must refer to a perk that supports upgrades. Keep alternative choices appropriate for players who have already progressed through the tree.

## sf2.items.set_presentation

Change an existing equipment item's shop icon, fighter model, or both while
keeping its identity and purchase state. Use typed asset handles so the asset
host checks their kind and ownership before registration.

**Signature:** `sf2.items.set_presentation { item, icon?, model? }`

**Returns:** Nothing (`nil`).

**When:** During mod loading, before shop and fighter copies are built. Apply &
Restart to load or remove the patch.

**Requires:** `content.patch`; item lookup needs `content.register`. Declare a
dependency on the item's owner and on any asset owner.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `item` | Equipment handle | Required weapon, armor, helm, ranged or magic item. |
| `icon` | Sprite handle | Optional icon from `sf2.assets.sprite`. |
| `model` | Model handle | Optional model from `sf2.assets.model`. |

Provide at least one of `icon` or `model`. An omitted field keeps its existing
value. Another presentation patch for the same item conflicts. Removing the mod
restores the previous icon and model for future copies; copies already built
keep their snapshot. Existing saved item identity stays the same.

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
local weapon = sf2.items.get("core:items/weapon/WEAPON_KUNAI")
sf2.items.set_presentation {
    item = weapon,
    icon = sf2.assets.sprite("core:UI/Items/weapon_kunai"),
}
```

The `core` dependency is required in `mod.toml` for this example. You can also
use a model owned by your mod. The content fingerprint includes both asset IDs.
Native checks cover registration, copying and rollback; verify the actual shop
thumbnail and fighter appearance in the game. DE128's isolated Unity check
also selects one changed icon in the live shop and equips a changed-model armor.

## sf2.items.set_initial_profile

Replace an existing equipment definition's starting level, upgrade level,
initial stat snapshot and optionally its upgrade template or legacy paid marker. Use this when the
item already exists and a mod changes its progression without replacing its
identity or shared purchase price.

**Signature:** `sf2.items.set_initial_profile { item, level, upgrade_level, initial_stats, upgrade_template?, legacy_paid_item?, clear_local_upgrades? }`

**Returns:** Nothing (`nil`).

**When:** During mod loading, after obtaining the item handle and before shop,
inventory and fighter copies are built. Apply & Restart to load or remove it.

**Requires:** `content.patch`; `sf2.items.get` also needs `content.register`.
Declare a dependency on the item's owner.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `item` | Equipment handle | Required. Weapon, armor, helm, ranged or magic. |
| `level` | Integer 1–52 | Required starting item level. |
| `upgrade_level` | Integer 0–5200 | Required starting upgrade level. This is the item's progression marker, not a price. |
| `initial_stats` | Table | Required complete initial stat snapshot. Values are integers 0–1,000,000. Allowed keys match the category tables in [explicit initial stats](../equipment-shop-logging/#explicit-initial-stats). Omitted keys remain absent. |
| `upgrade_template` | String | Optional. Leave out to retain the item's current template. To replace it, use `Weapon_Bonus` or `Paid_Weapon_Bonus` for a weapon, or the matching `Armor`, `Helm`, `Ranged`, or `Magic` pair. The selected template must exist in the native item catalog. |
| `legacy_paid_item` | `"none"`, `"paid"` or `"super_paid"` | Optional. Leave out to retain the item's current legacy `PaidItem` marker. `"none"` clears it; the other values set the corresponding native marker. This is metadata used by legacy conditions and statistics, not the shop price or currency. |
| `clear_local_upgrades` | Boolean | Optional, default `false`. Set `true` to remove the item's own XML-authored upgrade rows from future catalog copies. The selected shared `upgrade_template` still supplies its rows. |

```lua
local blade = sf2.items.get("core:items/weapon/WEAPON_BP_S1_GUARDIAN")
sf2.items.set_initial_profile {
    item = blade,
    level = 15,
    upgrade_level = 1500,
    initial_stats = { weapon_damage = 342 },
    upgrade_template = "Weapon_Bonus",
    legacy_paid_item = "none",
}
```

The patched catalog item supplies new purchase and fighter copies. Its source XML,
item ID, coin/gem price and shared upgrade table definitions stay unchanged.
Changing `upgrade_template` selects a different existing table, which can change
future upgrade prices and power. Changing `legacy_paid_item` does not change shop
visibility, the acquisition route, or the price; use the shop availability and
listing APIs for those behaviors.
Use `clear_local_upgrades = true` when replacing an item whose source definition
has one-off upgrade rows that should no longer supplement its selected shared
template. Removing the patch restores those rows; already saved inventory is not
rewritten.
Removing the mod restores the original catalog profile. Already saved inventory
is not migrated or re-leveled by this declaration. The host rejects wrong-category
stat keys or templates, invalid values, unavailable templates, unknown items and
competing patches to the same item.
The native copy and rollback paths have detached tests. DE128's isolated Unity
check also buys, upgrades, equips and reloads representative patched items.
Validate combat balance for each content pack in the game.

## sf2.items.set_subtype

Change the combat family of an existing weapon, ranged item or magic definition.
Native animation conditions and projectile selection use this subtype.

**Signature:** `sf2.items.set_subtype { item, subtype }`

**Returns:** Nothing (`nil`).

**When:** During mod loading, before profile equipment and fighters are built.

**Requires:** `content.patch`; obtaining an item handle also requires
`content.register`. Declare a dependency on the item's owner.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `item` | Required weapon, ranged or magic handle. Armor, helms and consumables are rejected. |
| `subtype` | Required case-sensitive string of 1–128 ASCII letters, digits or underscores. |

```lua
local weapon = sf2.items.get("core:items/weapon/WEAPON_CHNY22_SPEAR")
sf2.items.set_subtype { item = weapon, subtype = "Naginata" }
```

Choose a family with compatible native moves, rig edges and projectile behavior,
or register that behavior yourself. A syntactically valid family does not create
missing animations. For example, changing to `ChineseSwords` in the current base
also needs its stance and attack graph ported; supplying an animation file alone
is insufficient.

Item IDs, models, prices, power, enchantments and saved ownership are unchanged.
The subtype feeds AI grouping only when the item has no explicit tactic group;
use `set_tactic_subtype` separately to change an explicit group. Competing patches
to the same item's subtype fail atomically, while an AI-group or availability
patch is a separate field and can coexist.

The native item must exist when content is applied; an owned item normally needs
a supported listing or another supported registration path that creates it.
Duplicate legacy names are resolved against their original definition nodes.
Missing native targets roll back earlier applied subtype patches. Apply & Restart
without the mod restores the original subtype. Existing fighter copies retain
their snapshot until rebuilt; this is not a mid-fight transformation operation.
Subtype patches participate in the content compatibility fingerprint.

## sf2.items.set_tactic_subtype

Replace the AI table group of a core or owned weapon without changing its animation subtype.

**Signature:** `sf2.items.set_tactic_subtype { item = ItemHandle, group = string }`

**Returns:** Nothing (`nil`).

**When:** During entrypoint registration. The override applies when content is loaded, before subsequent fights are constructed.

**Requires:** `content.patch`; item lookup also requires `content.register`. Declare dependencies for referenced namespaces.

Both fields are required. `item` must resolve to a weapon. `group` is a native AI table group containing at most 128 ASCII letters, digits or underscores. An empty string explicitly selects the weapon's actual subtype instead of an existing separate AI group. It does not create AI tables or animation moves; supply a group supported by your tactics.

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
sf2.items.set_tactic_subtype {
    item = sf2.items.get("core:items/weapon/WEAPON_TWO_HANDED_MACE"),
    group = "TwoHanded",
}
```

Only one override may target a weapon; duplicate registrations or another mod's override fail instead of silently winning by load order. This can compose with default enchantments and innate perks on the same item. An owned weapon must have a supported shop listing so its native item exists when applying content. Prefer the `tactic_subtype` registration field for a new weapon unless a separate override is needed.

The group participates in the content compatibility fingerprint. Disabling the mod and applying/restarting restores the original native group, and partial application failures restore earlier targets. Existing fight copies retain their snapshot; this operation does not refresh a running fighter or edit inventory saves. Native projection, rollback and Lua validation have automated coverage; physical combat acceptance remains a separate playtest.

## sf2.items.set_innate_perks

**Signature:** `sf2.items.set_innate_perks(definition)`

**Returns:** Nothing (`nil`).

**When:** During mod loading, before fighters are built.

**Requires:** `content.patch`; item/perk lookup or registration also requires `content.register`. Declare dependencies for referenced core or other-mod content.

Replaces the permanent perks attached to an equipment definition. The normal combat equipment collector includes these perks whenever that equipment is used. This applies to already owned equipment in subsequently built fighters too. It does not write an enchantment to inventory or change acquisition defaults.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `item` | Required weapon, armor, helm, ranged or magic handle. |
| `entries` | Required dense array of zero to 64 perk entries. Empty removes the item's innate perks. |
| `entries[].perk` | Required existing perk handle, once per loadout. Register owned perks first. |
| `entries[].parameters` | Optional table of up to 64 named finite numbers. Defaults to empty, preserving the perk's authored defaults. |

Parameter names must begin with an ASCII letter or underscore, contain only ASCII letters, digits or underscores, and be at most 128 characters. Values are stored as single-precision numbers; values that overflow that format are rejected. Strings, expressions, booleans, NaN and infinity are not accepted. Use names understood by the chosen perk: this API does not invent behavior for unknown parameters.

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
-- capabilities = ["content.register", "content.patch"]
-- Also declare the core dependency in mod.toml.
sf2.items.set_innate_perks {
    item = sf2.items.get("core:items/weapon/WEAPON_KNIVES"),
    entries = {
        { perk = sf2.perks.get("core:perks/PERK_ITEM_SPECIAL_PRECISION_WEAPON"),
          parameters = { Aspect = 100 } },
    },
}
```

This attaches the native precision perk to Knives as an innate equipment effect. It is separate from the forge enchantment saved on a particular inventory item. For custom procedures, register a Lua-backed perk using the perk API and attach its handle with no loadout parameters. Lua-backed perks take their initial parameters at perk registration; nonempty loadout parameters for them are rejected. Keep conditional behavior in their callbacks rather than encoding expressions in this table.

The target must be present in the applied native item catalog. Owned items need their supported shop registration so they are materialized. Perk instances are cloned per item, preserving the registry and other equipment from the combat collector's mutable weapon/non-weapon marker.

Two innate loadouts targeting the same item conflict. An innate loadout and a default-enchantment loadout can coexist on that item. Their entry order and parameter values participate in the compatibility fingerprint. Failed application restores earlier changes from that adapter; unloading restores the original innate list. Use Apply & Restart when changing active mods. Already constructed fighters are not refreshed by this operation.

Player-side Lua callbacks for active innate perks receive `fighter.source = "innate"`, `item_id`, `item_type` and `perk_id`. They do not require a saved inventory enchantment, including when a rule supplies the equipment. Native perk filtering still controls eligibility. One perk ID dispatches once per event across equipment: learned/profile perks with an available saved instance take precedence, then innate perks, then saved enchantments. A missing learned save node does not suppress an otherwise active innate perk. An innate instance retains state between events within its fight but has no persistent profile backing; use mod-owned saved state for progress that must survive fights. Opponent callbacks retain their existing `"warrior"` provenance.

This does not expose automatic activated abilities, arbitrary item metadata or permanent profile mutation. Native collection, ownership, rollback, player dispatch and Lua validation are tested; live combat behavior still needs acceptance testing with the chosen perk.

## sf2.items.set_default_enchantments

**Signature:** `sf2.items.set_default_enchantments(definition)`

**Returns:** Nothing (`nil`).

**When:** During mod loading.

**Requires:** `content.patch`; item/perk lookup or registration also requires `content.register`. Declare dependencies for referenced content from core or other mods.

Replaces an equipment item's default enchantment loadout. Shop previews and the native acquisition path use the replacement. This does not grant the item, re-enchant existing inventory, or attach permanent innate effects. Previously saved enchantments retain their values.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `item` | Required equipment handle, from registration or `sf2.items.get`. Weapon, armor, helm, ranged and magic items are supported. |
| `entries` | Required dense array of zero to 64 entries. An empty array removes the acquisition defaults. |
| `entries[].perk` | Required existing perk handle. Each perk may appear only once. Register owned perks before this call. |
| `entries[].aspect` | Optional signed 32-bit integer, copied as the enchantment's explicit aspect. Omit it to preserve the perk's normal default. This is a value, not a formula or expression. |

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
-- capabilities = ["content.register", "content.patch"]
-- Also declare the core dependency in mod.toml.
sf2.items.set_default_enchantments {
    item = sf2.items.get("core:items/weapon/WEAPON_KNIVES"),
    entries = {
        { perk = sf2.perks.get("core:perks/PERK_ITEM_SPECIAL_PRECISION_WEAPON"),
          aspect = 100 },
    },
}
```

Choose an aspect appropriate for your content; accepting an integer does not mean every value produces useful gameplay. Prices, equipment levels and shared stat scaling remain unchanged. The native acquisition path still determines when default enchantments are applied.

The target must exist in the applied native item catalog. For an owned item, use its supported shop registration so the adapter materializes it before applying the loadout. This call does not create a missing native item or substitute an acquisition route.

Two mods targeting the same item conflict, even if their loadouts match. Different items can coexist. Unknown fields, duplicate perks, sparse arrays and unresolved dependencies fail loading. A later native apply failure restores earlier loadouts from that adapter. Unloading restores the original preview and acquisition lists; use Apply & Restart after enabling or disabling the mod.

Loadout order, perk IDs and optional aspects participate in the content compatibility fingerprint. Changing defaults does not migrate existing equipment. Automated checks cover Lua registration, native projection and rollback; full-game acquisition, saves and preview rendering still need acceptance testing.

## sf2.forge.profile

**Signature:** `sf2.forge.profile(reference)`

**Returns:** A forge economy-profile handle.

**When:** During mod loading.

**Requires:** `content.register`, and a declared dependency when reading another mod's content.

Looks up an existing profile that supplies the forge's costs and timing. A short name such as `"Simple"` is resolved as `"core:forge-profiles/Simple"`. `"Complex"` is another existing core profile. Definition IDs normalize casing; an unknown profile fails loading.

```lua
local economy = sf2.forge.profile("Simple")
```

The handle is an input for a recipe. It is not a table of editable prices. To give
your own recipes their own prices, register a profile with
[`sf2.forge.register_profile`](#sf2forgeregister_profile).

## sf2.forge.register_profile

**Signature:** `sf2.forge.register_profile(definition)`

**Returns:** A forge economy-profile handle, usable as a recipe's `economic_profile`.

**When:** During mod loading, before the recipes that use it.

**Requires:** `content.register`.

Declares the forge-material prices for your own recipe families. A forge *price
profile* says how many of each forge material (ForgeMaterial1, 2 and 3) one
enchantment costs, depending on the level of the item being enchanted. Core
profiles such as `Simple` and `Complex` keep their prices: a profile you register
is used only by recipes from your mod, never by core recipes or another mod's.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | String | Required local identifier, such as `abilities`. Becomes `<your mod>:forge-profiles/<id>`. |
| `prices` | Array | Required. One price table per equipment category, each category at most once. |

Each `prices` entry has:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `equipment` | Equipment constant | Required: `sf2.forge.WEAPON`, `ARMOR`, `HELM`, `RANGED` or `MAGIC`. |
| `rows` | Array | Required, 1–64 rows in ascending, non-overlapping level order. |

Each row covers a range of item levels:

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `level` | Integer | — | One exact item level. Use this *or* `min_level`/`max_level`, not both. |
| `min_level` | Integer | `1` | First item level the row applies to, 1–1000. |
| `max_level` | Integer | No upper limit | Last item level, up to 1000. Omit it on the final row to cover every higher level. |
| `materials` | Integer array | Required | 1–3 counts for ForgeMaterial1, 2 and 3, each 0–10,000,000. At least one must be above zero. |

A recipe item can only use a category the profile prices, so give every
equipment category in your recipe's `items` a table here. An item whose level no
row covers cannot be enchanted with that recipe. Rows have no delivery timer: the
enchantment completes immediately.

```lua
local abilities_price = sf2.forge.register_profile {
    id = "abilities",
    prices = {
        { equipment = sf2.forge.WEAPON, rows = {
            { max_level = 2, materials = { 38, 10, 5 } },  -- levels 1-2
            { level = 3, materials = { 46, 13, 6 } },
            { min_level = 4, materials = { 56, 17, 8 } },   -- level 4 and above
        } },
    },
}

sf2.forge.register_recipe {
    id = "abilities",
    economic_profile = abilities_price,
    items = { { equipment = sf2.forge.WEAPON } },
    candidates = { { perk = my_ability_perk, equipment = sf2.forge.WEAPON } },
}
```

`sf2.forge.exclude_candidate` and `sf2.forge.override_deviation` still target core
profiles only. Profile prices are part of the content compatibility fingerprint,
so changing them is a content change. Disabling the mod removes the profile
together with its recipes.

## sf2.forge.register_recipe

**Signature:** `sf2.forge.register_recipe(definition)`

**Returns:** A forge-recipe handle.

**When:** During mod loading.

**Requires:** `content.register`.

Creates a recipe using an existing economy profile and a pool of eligible enchantments.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Required local identifier. |
| `alias` | Optional compatibility alias; defaults to an empty string. |
| `economic_profile` | Required handle from `sf2.forge.profile`, or from `sf2.forge.register_profile` in this mod. |
| `items` | Required array of equipment-category settings. |
| `candidates` | Required array of eligible perks/enchantments. |

Equipment categories are `sf2.forge.WEAPON`, `ARMOR`, `HELM`, `RANGED`, and `MAGIC` (string values `"weapon"`, `"armor"`, `"helm"`, `"ranged"`, `"magic"`).

Each `items` entry requires `equipment`. Optional fields are `enchantments` (integer, default `1`), `bar_scale` (string, default empty), `min_deviation` and `max_deviation` (integers, default `0`), and `random_aspect` (boolean, default `false`). These describe the recipe's enchantment presentation and roll behavior; they are not currency prices.

Each `candidates` entry requires `perk` (a perk handle from `sf2.perks.register`) and `equipment`. Optional integer `min_level` and `max_level` restrict eligibility; omitting them leaves the candidate unrestricted by level. Use explicit sensible bounds for your content.

```lua
-- training_perk is a handle from sf2.perks.register.
local recipe = sf2.forge.register_recipe {
    id = "training_recipe",
    economic_profile = sf2.forge.profile("Simple"),
    items = { { equipment = sf2.forge.WEAPON, enchantments = 1 } },
    candidates = {
        { perk = training_perk, equipment = sf2.forge.WEAPON,
          min_level = 1, max_level = 52 },
    },
}
```

A registered enchantment must still be made obtainable through a recipe or another supported equipment/perk route before its combat behavior can run.

Registering a new family does not change the original family's candidate pool or costs.

## sf2.forge.exclude_candidate

**Signature:** `sf2.forge.exclude_candidate(definition)`

**Returns:** Nothing (`nil`).

**When:** During mod loading.

**Requires:** `content.patch`, `content.register` for handle lookups, and a declared `core` dependency.

Removes a native enchantment from one core recipe's eligible pool for one equipment category while the mod configuration is applied. Both candidate previews and subsequent rolls use this pool. It does not remove enchantments already on equipment, delete the perk, or change prices, timers or power deviations.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `profile` | Required core profile handle from `sf2.forge.profile`. Selects the native recipe with that profile's name. |
| `perk` | Required existing core perk handle from `sf2.perks.get`. |
| `equipment` | Required category: `sf2.forge.WEAPON`, `ARMOR`, `HELM`, `RANGED`, or `MAGIC`. |

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
-- capabilities = ["content.register", "content.patch"]
-- Also declare the core dependency in mod.toml.
sf2.forge.exclude_candidate {
    profile = sf2.forge.profile("Complex"),
    perk = sf2.perks.get("core:perks/PERK_MONK_SET_WHIRL"),
    equipment = sf2.forge.WEAPON,
}
```

This example excludes the Monk set enchantment from Complex weapon rolls. Other equipment categories remain unchanged. All native occurrences of that candidate are filtered; independently added mod candidates are unaffected.

Duplicate exclusions for the same recipe, equipment and perk conflict, including duplicates from different mods. Different targets can coexist. Unknown fields, invalid categories and non-core targets are rejected. Registration validates the handles; the native adapter additionally checks that the recipe supports the equipment and contains the candidate when applying content. Failure aborts application and restores exclusions already applied by that adapter.

Unloading the applied content restores the original native candidate pool. Enable or disable the mod through Apply & Restart to change the active configuration. This function does not yet edit native candidate level conditions, replace entire families or modify native recipe item settings.

## sf2.forge.override_deviation

**Signature:** `sf2.forge.override_deviation(definition)`

**Returns:** Nothing (`nil`).

**When:** During mod loading.

**Requires:** `content.patch`, `content.register` for the profile lookup, and a declared `core` dependency.

Changes the random enchantment-power delta for one equipment category in an existing core recipe. The game still calculates the base aspect from its normal level curve, then adds a random integer from `minimum` through `maximum`, inclusive. Prices, timers and the base curve remain unchanged. Already enchanted equipment keeps its existing power.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `profile` | Required core recipe profile handle from `sf2.forge.profile`. |
| `equipment` | Required `sf2.forge.WEAPON`, `ARMOR`, `HELM`, `RANGED`, or `MAGIC`. |
| `minimum` | Required integer, at least `-10000` and no greater than `maximum`. |
| `maximum` | Required integer, at most `10000` and no less than `minimum`. |

The limits are validation bounds, not recommended balance values. Start close to the original recipe's range and test the resulting power at several equipment levels.

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
-- capabilities = ["content.register", "content.patch"]
-- Also declare the core dependency in mod.toml.
sf2.forge.override_deviation {
    profile = sf2.forge.profile("Simple"),
    equipment = sf2.forge.WEAPON,
    minimum = 15,
    maximum = 75,
}
```

This replaces the Simple weapon category's native `-30..30` range with `15..75`. Both the effective recipe item settings and copied roll candidates use the override. Other equipment categories retain their original settings. The source recipe and perk definitions remain intact.

Only categories already using random aspect are supported. Simple and Medium have such categories; Complex's fixed-aspect categories are rejected when content is applied. A candidate's complete native `RandomAspect` expression is updated; fixed values, missing aspect values and compound expressions are preserved. Independently added candidates with a complete random-aspect expression use the same category override.

Two overrides targeting the same recipe/category conflict, even with equal bounds. Different categories compose, and candidate exclusions can coexist with a deviation override. Applying an invalid native target rolls back earlier forge changes from that adapter. Unloading restores the original settings; use Apply & Restart when changing the active mods.

The bounds participate in the content compatibility fingerprint. Changing them is a content change even if the mod's version is unchanged. This function does not replace entire recipe families, change fixed-aspect recipes into random ones, or edit arbitrary candidate conditions.
