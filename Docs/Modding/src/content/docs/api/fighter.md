title: Fighter methods
description: Observe combat, move fighters, change health and magic charge, reduce pending damage, and manage temporary shields in callbacks.
---

For objective-based victories and defeats, see
[`fighter:end_round`](../round-outcomes/#fighterend_round). It requires a declared
controller rule and queues a round result through the normal offline result flow.

These methods are supplied as the `fighter` argument to supported
[combat callbacks](../combat-callbacks/). Use a colon (`:`), which passes the
fighter as the method's first argument. They are not global `sf2` functions.

The examples below run **inside a callback**. A fighter reference must not be
saved and used after that callback returns. Missing capability declarations,
expired references, invalid values, or an unavailable fighter raise Lua errors.
Most mutation methods return `nil` on success; exceptions are documented below.
Observation methods return detached data.

For native collision-rig rectangle queries and owned arena warning art, see
[Arena regions and markers](../arena/).

## fighter:snapshot

Read fresh combat observations, including both fighters and the engine's elapsed
fight clock. Use this when making a health or distance
decision; the older `fighter.health` field is captured at callback entry.

**Signature:** `fighter:snapshot()`

**Returns:** A `CombatSnapshot` table, or `nil` if the fighter cannot be observed.

**When:** Inside any supported combat behavior callback, including battle rules,
perks, enchantments, warrior behaviors and attached actor behaviors. Each call samples the current state.
The callable reference expires when that callback returns; the returned data may
be retained as an observation, but will not update itself.

**Requires:** No additional capability. Observing the opponent does not require
`combat.target`; changing the opponent still requires the normal capabilities.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `self` | The fighter receiving this callback, even when it is the enemy. |
| `opponent` | This fighter's current native target snapshot, or `nil` when unavailable. It can be a main fighter or an independent actor. |
| `frame` | Nonnegative elapsed active-fight frame count, shared by both sides. |
| `seconds` | `frame / 60`, using the recovered engine's simulation rate. |
| `round_active` | Whether the engine is processing the round at capture time. |

Both fighter snapshots contain `health`, `max_health`, `health_bars`, and
`position = { x, y, z }`. Health uses the same normalized pool units as
`fighter.health`; `max_health` is the maximum in those units. `health_bars` is
the total authored bar count (at least one), not the number remaining. For
multi-bar opponents, incoming damage operations use single-bar units; do not
equate the normalized pool with damage points. Divide health by max health for
a fraction, guarding against a zero maximum.

Each fighter snapshot may also have an `actor` table when the observed root is
an initialized independent fighter. Main fighters omit it. This applies to
[actor snapshots](../actors/#actorsnapshot) and [Lua AI observations](../moves-and-tactics/#sf2tacticsregister).

| Actor field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Live fight-local actor instance ID, such as `a1`; changes when a replacement is spawned. |
| `definition` | Qualified actor definition ID, such as `my.mod:actors/helper`. |
| `owner` | Mod that owns this actor instance. |
| `team` | Absolute `"player"` or `"opponent"` team, irrespective of who receives this observation. |

These are copied observations, not actor handles or permissions. Editing them
cannot retarget, transfer ownership or change a team. Retained snapshots remain
historical data; reacquire a live scoped actor reference for commands.

Each fighter snapshot also has an optional `animation` table.
It is `nil` when the native controller is absent, stopped, or cannot provide a
valid bounded observation. The rest of the fighter snapshot remains available.

| Animation field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Native name of the currently playing animation, including authored namespaced moves. |
| `type` | Native authored classification: `"none"`, `"move"`, or `"attack"`. |
| `facing` | Native orientation sign: `1` along positive model X, `-1` along negative model X. |
| `intervals` | Array of currently active `{ name, type }` interval observations, in native order. May be empty; at most 256 entries. |

Interval `type` is one of `"none"`, `"unstable"`, `"uninterrupt"`,
`"self_uninterrupt"`, `"attack"`, `"block"`, `"invulnerable"`, or
`"invisible"`. `name` preserves the authored interval name, or is empty when
the native interval has no name. Custom named intervals may have type `"none"`.
These are observations from the controller's latest interval update, not the
animation's complete list of future windows. An active attack interval does not
guarantee contact; an interval label does not override other native combat rules.

For example, inside a callback you can detect an opponent's active attack window:

```lua
local combat = fighter:snapshot()
local animation = combat and combat.opponent and combat.opponent.animation
local attacking = false
if animation then
    for _, interval in ipairs(animation.intervals) do
        if interval.type == "attack" then attacking = true; break end
    end
end
-- Use attacking in your own Lua rule logic.
```

Animation and interval tables are detached
values: editing them cannot start/stop an animation, turn a fighter, or add/remove
an interval. They can be retained as historical observations, but never used as
an AI candidate or an engine operation handle.

Positions use arena model coordinates, not screen pixels or metres. The clock
counts active fight frames across rounds, excluding round transitions and frames
when fight processing is stopped; it is neither wall time nor the remaining round
timer. Capture a baseline in `on_round_begin` to measure a round-local duration.
This method does not schedule callbacks or grant control of the clock.

```lua
on_damage_resolving = function(self, fighter, event)
    local combat = fighter:snapshot()
    if not combat or combat.self.max_health <= 0 then return end
    local fraction = combat.self.health / combat.self.max_health
    if fraction < 0.25 then
        fighter:scale_incoming_damage(0.5) -- requires combat.modify_hit
    end
end
```

Each result is a detached Lua table. Editing it affects only your copy and cannot
move a fighter, change health, alter later snapshots, or change the engine clock.
Call again after a health operation to obtain a fresh observation. Query failure
does not fabricate zero health or a default position.

## fighter:scale_outgoing_damage

Scale the current attacker's pending hit.

**Signature:** `fighter:scale_outgoing_damage(multiplier)`

**Returns:** `nil` on success; invalid values, missing capability, unavailable hit
or expired references raise a Lua error.

**When:** Inside `on_damage_dealing`, and inside attacker-side `on_post_hit` where
`event.target == "opponent"`. It is absent from `on_hit_post_crit` and incoming
`on_post_hit` callbacks.

**Requires:** `combat.modify_outgoing_hit`.

```lua
on_damage_dealing = function(parameters, fighter, event)
    fighter:scale_outgoing_damage(1.25)
end
```

The multiplier must be finite and between 0 and 16 inclusive. The resulting
damage must remain finite, nonnegative, and representable as a single-precision
number. Invalid scaling leaves the pending value unchanged. Calls multiply the
current value; zero remains zero. Invulnerability, shields, incoming modifiers,
and the normal health path run afterward. This does not bypass defense or change
the shared weapon/stat economy. Earlier successful operations remain applied if
a later handler fails. Retained methods cannot modify a later hit.

## fighter:add_outgoing_damage

Add normalized health damage to the current attacker's pending hit.

**Signature:** `fighter:add_outgoing_damage(amount)`

**Requires:** `combat.modify_outgoing_hit`.

**When:** Inside `on_damage_dealing`, and inside attacker-side `on_post_hit` where
`event.target == "opponent"`. It is absent from `on_hit_post_crit` and incoming
post-hit callbacks.

**Returns:** `nil` on success; invalid values, missing capability, unavailable hit
or expired references raise a Lua error.

`amount` must be finite and from `0` through `1` normalized health units. It is
added to the current pending damage value; the resulting value must remain finite,
nonnegative and representable as a single-precision number. Defender rules and
normal health application still run afterward.

```lua
fighter:add_outgoing_damage(0.04)
```

## fighter:change_health

Add or subtract health through the game's normal health-change path.

**Signature:** `fighter:change_health(amount)`

**Requires:** `combat.change_life`.

**When:** A supported callback with a live fighter capability.

**Returns:** `nil`.

`amount` is a finite number representable by a 32-bit float. Positive values
heal; negative values damage. Values use the game's life units rather than a
separate percentage-conversion API. A fighter whose health has already reached
zero cannot be revived with this operation.

```lua
fighter:change_health(0.05)
```

Use small values and test them against the relevant opponent and health-bar
configuration. Healing after `on_damage_received` does not reverse a lethal hit.

## fighter:add_magic_charge

Add to the fighter's magic charge and let the game normalize it.

**Signature:** `fighter:add_magic_charge(amount)`

**Requires:** `combat.magic_charge`.

**When:** A supported callback with a fighter capability.

**Returns:** `nil`.

`amount` must be a finite 32-bit-float value. The example adds 0.35 charge through
the normal magic-charge path. The player needs a usable magic item to observe it.

```lua
fighter:add_magic_charge(0.35)
```

## fighter.opponent:change_health

Apply the health-change operation to the opposing fighter.

**Signature:** `fighter.opponent:change_health(amount)`

**Requires:** Both `combat.target` and `combat.change_life`.

**When:** A supported callback where `fighter.opponent` is available.

**Returns:** `nil`; the same numeric and no-revival rules as `change_health` apply.

```lua
if fighter.opponent then
    fighter.opponent:change_health(-0.05)
end
```

## fighter.opponent:add_magic_charge

Adjust the opposing fighter's magic charge.

**Signature:** `fighter.opponent:add_magic_charge(amount)`

**Requires:** Both `combat.target` and `combat.magic_charge`.

**When:** A supported callback where the opponent is available.

**Returns:** `nil`; accepts a finite 32-bit-float number.

```lua
if fighter.opponent then
    fighter.opponent:add_magic_charge(0.1)
end
```

The opponent target also exposes [`move_by`](#fighteropponentmove_by) and
[`play_move`](#fighteropponentplay_move). There are
no opponent shield or opponent pending-hit methods on this target object.

## fighter:scale_incoming_damage

Multiply this fighter's pending incoming damage before it is applied.

**Signature:** `fighter:scale_incoming_damage(multiplier)`

**Requires:** `combat.modify_hit`.

**When:** Only inside `on_damage_resolving`.

**Returns:** `nil`.

`multiplier` is finite and between 0 and 1 inclusive. `0` prevents this hit's
damage, `0.5` halves it, and `1` leaves it unchanged. Values above 1 are rejected.
Multiple active behaviors multiply in dispatch order.

```lua
fighter:scale_incoming_damage(0.5)
```

Calling this after damage has resolved is too late; the method is not supplied
in those callbacks.

## fighter:add_damage_shield

Apply temporary damage reduction to future hits.

**Signature:** `fighter:add_damage_shield(key, fraction, frames)`

**Requires:** `combat.effects`.

**When:** A supported callback with fighter effect operations.

**Returns:** `nil`.

| Argument | Type and bounds | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | 1–64 letters, digits, or underscores | Name used to refresh/remove this behavior's shield. |
| `fraction` | Finite number, 0–1 | Fraction of damage reduced; `0.25` means 25% reduction. |
| `frames` | Integer, 1–3600 | Duration in simulation frames; 60 frames is one combat second. |

```lua
fighter:add_damage_shield("opening_ward", 0.25, 180)
```

This requests 25% reduction for three combat seconds. Reusing a key refreshes
that behavior's shield; different keys can compound. At most 128 shields are
active per fighter. The timer pauses with combat and shields clear at round/fight
cleanup. They do not add native buff icons or extra boss health bars.

## fighter:remove_damage_shield

Remove a shield created under this behavior's key.

**Signature:** `fighter:remove_damage_shield(key)`

**Requires:** `combat.effects`.

**When:** A supported callback with fighter effect operations.

**Returns:** `nil`.

`key` uses the same naming rules as `add_damage_shield`. It is scoped by the
behavior identity; this does not remove arbitrary native effects.

```lua
fighter:remove_damage_shield("opening_ward")
```

## fighter:set_flag

Create a native combat flag owned by this behavior instance.

**Signature:** `fighter:set_flag(key)`

**Requires:** `combat.effects`.

**When:** A supported callback during an active round, with a currently registered
fighter. The method expires when the callback returns.

**Returns:** The qualified native flag name as a string. Setting an existing key
does nothing and returns the same name. Invalid input or unavailable support raises
a Lua error.

`key` is 1–64 ASCII letters, digits or underscores. The native name is
`<qualified behavior ID>:<key>` and must fit within 128 characters in total.
For behavior `example.spell:behaviors/cast`, key `pending` becomes
`example.spell:behaviors/cast:pending`.

```lua
on_animation_start = function(parameters, fighter, event)
    if event.target == "self"
        and event.animation_name == sf2.mod.id .. ":moves/cast" then
        fighter:set_flag("pending")
    end
end,
```

Flags have no timer. Clear them explicitly or let native round/fight cleanup
remove them; they are not saved in the profile. They participate in native
modifier lists, `mod_exists` conditions, expiry notifications and fighter form
transfers. There are at most 64 flag-owning instances per fighter registration
and 64 active flags per instance; exceeding either limit raises an error.

Ownership includes both behavior identity and equipped/rule instance. One instance
cannot clear another instance's flags, even if both use the same key. Native move
conditions see the qualified name, so they match any active instance using that
name. This method cannot create or overwrite a core flag such as `Stun`.

## fighter:has_flag

Check this behavior instance's flag without changing it.

**Signature:** `fighter:has_flag(key)`

**Requires:** `combat.effects`.

**When:** A supported callback during an active round with a registered fighter.

**Returns:** `true` if this instance owns the flag, otherwise `false`. Invalid
keys, expired callback references or unavailable support raise a Lua error.

```lua
if fighter:has_flag("pending") then
    sf2.log.info("This cast still owns its pending flag")
end
```

The key and length rules are the same as `set_flag`. This does not query arbitrary
native modifiers or another instance's state.

## fighter:clear_flag

Remove this behavior instance's flag through native modifier expiry handling.

**Signature:** `fighter:clear_flag(key)`

**Requires:** `combat.effects`.

**When:** A supported callback during an active round with a registered fighter.

**Returns:** `nil`. Clearing an absent key succeeds without emitting another
expiry event. Invalid keys, expired methods or unavailable support raise an error.

```lua
fighter:clear_flag("pending")
```

Clearing an existing flag removes it from `mod_exists` observations and emits the
native `ModExpires` event for its qualified name. A move can listen using
`events = { { type = "mod_expires", name = "example.spell:behaviors/cast:pending" } }`.
Normal move conditions, locks and priority still decide whether that move runs.
Clearing one instance emits its expiry even if another instance retains a flag
with the same qualified name. For purely Lua bookkeeping with no native move
interaction, prefer declared behavior state.

## fighter:set_control_blocked

Restrict one player action for this behavior instance.

**Signature:** `fighter:set_control_blocked(control, blocked)`

**Returns:** `nil`. Invalid arguments, expired references, unavailable support,
or exceeding the source limit raise a Lua error.

**When:** A behavior callback for the player during an active round, including
`on_fight_begin` and `on_round_begin` setup before combat starts. Unavailable for
opponents, after a round ends, and in local versus.

**Requires:** `combat.effects`.

`control` is one of the case-sensitive strings `"punch"`, `"kick"`, `"ranged"`,
`"magic"`, or `"raid_charge"`. `blocked` must be a boolean.

```lua
local restriction = sf2.behaviors.register {
    id = "restricted_magic",
    on_round_begin = function(parameters, fighter)
        fighter:set_control_blocked("magic", true)
    end,
}
sf2.rules.behavior {
    id = "restricted_magic", behavior = restriction, target = sf2.rules.PLAYER,
}
-- Attach the returned rule to a fight's rules list to apply it.
```

`true` hides and blocks the action through the shared touch, keyboard and gamepad
gate. Blocking a held action releases it; resuming requires neutral input followed
by a fresh press. `false` releases only this behavior instance's restriction. It
cannot override another instance, a native `no_button` rule, or ordinary equipment
and charge availability, and does not force a hidden ability button to appear.

Restrictions persist across callbacks and pause/resume. They clear when the next
round is prepared or the fight ends; reapply them in `on_round_begin` when needed.
Repeated calls are idempotent. Ownership includes the behavior and its attached
perk/rule instance. At most 256 instances can hold restrictions per controller;
each can block all five actions. Releasing an instance's last block frees its slot.

## fighter:set_button_cooldown

Start a recharge animation on one of this fighter's combat buttons.

**Signature:** `fighter:set_button_cooldown(control, frames)`

**Requires:** `combat.effects`.

**When:** A supported callback during an active round, with a currently registered
fighter. The method expires when the callback returns.

**Returns:** `nil`. Unknown controls, out-of-range frames, an inactive round or an
expired fighter raise a Lua error.

| Argument | Type and bounds | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `control` | String | `"punch"`, `"kick"`, `"ranged"` or `"raid_charge"`. |
| `frames` | Integer, 1–3600 | Native combat frames (60 per second) for the button's progress ring to refill. |

```lua
-- After the ability is used, show a ten-second recharge on the RaidCharge button.
on_animation_start = function(self, fighter, event)
    if event.target == "self" and event.animation_name == "SummonAssistant" then
        fighter:set_button_cooldown("raid_charge", 600)
    end
end,
```

This is the same presentation as the native `SetCooldown` perk action: the button
empties and refills over `frames`. It only changes what the button shows. It does
not stop the move from being used; gate the move itself with a timed
[flag](#fighterset_flag) and a `not_mod` move condition. Calling it again restarts
the ring. Only the player's buttons are drawn, so an opponent's call has no visible
effect. The magic button's ring follows the magic charge and is not supported here.

## fighter:set_control_visible

Show the RaidCharge button in a fight that would otherwise hide it.

**Signature:** `fighter:set_control_visible(control, visible)`

**Requires:** `combat.effects`.

**When:** A supported callback during an active round, with a currently registered
fighter. The method expires when the callback returns.

**Returns:** `nil`. An unsupported control, a non-boolean `visible`, an inactive
round or an expired fighter raises a Lua error.

| Argument | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `control` | String | `"raid_charge"`. Other buttons follow their equipment and are not supported. |
| `visible` | Boolean | `true` shows the button, `false` hides it again. |

```lua
-- An equipped ability uses the RaidCharge input, so show its button.
on_tick = function(self, fighter, event)
    if not self.state.shown then
        self.state.shown = true
        fighter:set_control_visible("raid_charge", true)
    end
end,
```

The game normally shows the RaidCharge button only in raid fights where the
player carries raid charges. Use this when your perk or enchantment adds a move
on the RaidCharge input in other fights. The raid charge count is not shown on a
button made visible this way. A [control restriction](#fighterset_control_blocked)
still hides a blocked button. Only the player's button is drawn: for an opponent
or in Local Versus the call succeeds and changes nothing. The next fight starts
with the game's own visibility again.

## fighter:show_status_icon

Show or refresh a transient status icon owned by this behavior instance.

**Signature:** `fighter:show_status_icon(key, sprite, frames, stacks?)`

**Requires:** `combat.effects`.

**When:** A supported behavior callback with a live fighter capability.

**Returns:** `nil`; invalid arguments, unavailable native support or an expired
fighter method raise a Lua error.

| Argument | Type and bounds | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | Valid behavior field name | Local key used to refresh or clear this behavior instance's icon. |
| `sprite` | Sprite handle | Captured sprite handle from the current mod context. |
| `frames` | Integer, 1–3600 | Native-frame lifetime. `0` is rejected. |
| `stacks` | Integer, 0–10000 | Optional stack count; defaults to `0`. |

```lua
local icon = sf2.assets.sprite("core:ui/skills/IconCrackedApple_Blue")
fighter:show_status_icon("relentless", icon, 300, 5)
```

The native key includes the behavior instance identity, so matching Lua keys from
different behavior instances are isolated. The method expires when the callback
returns. This documents the scripting contract only; it does not claim rendered
HUD acceptance for a particular sprite.

## fighter:clear_status_icon

Clear a status icon addressed by this behavior instance.

**Signature:** `fighter:clear_status_icon(key)`

**Requires:** `combat.effects`.

**When:** A supported behavior callback with a live fighter capability.

**Returns:** `nil`; invalid keys, unavailable native support or expired references
raise a Lua error.

```lua
fighter:clear_status_icon("relentless")
```

The key uses the same validation and behavior-instance isolation as
`show_status_icon`; it does not clear arbitrary status entries owned elsewhere.

## fighter:move_by

Queue an additive displacement of the current main fighter.

**Signature:** `fighter:move_by(x, y, z?)`

**Returns:** `true, nil` for an accepted request; `false, reason` when the native
host cannot accept it. Invalid arguments, missing capabilities, expired methods
or forbidden callback timing raise a Lua error. Acceptance is not a completion
receipt and does not change a snapshot taken in the same callback.

**When:** An active simulation callback with a living main fighter in an offline
fight. Unavailable in `on_fight_begin`, `on_round_begin`, `on_round_end` and
`on_fight_end`, while paused, after round ending, in training/title sparring,
local versus, legacy PvP and online raids. Offline mod raid encounters are eligible.

**Requires:** `combat.motion`.

```lua
-- Inside on_tick, when your ability becomes ready:
local accepted, reason = fighter:move_by(80, 0)
if not accepted then sf2.log.warn(reason) end
```

`x` and `y` are required finite numbers; `z` is optional and defaults to `0`
(including an explicit `nil`). Each axis must be within `-1000..1000` native rig
units. Positive X is independent of facing, positive Y is downward (negative Y moves upward); these are
relative offsets, not pixels, destinations or velocities. Only two or three
arguments are accepted. Both colon and dot-call syntax are supported.

Accepted requests add together for each body and apply once after model,
collision and animation processing, before round arbitration and interpolation
capture. The running sum must stay within the same per-axis bound; at most 32
nonzero requests can be pending per body per step across all behaviors/mods.
A rejection preserves earlier accepted requests. Zero offsets consume no slot.

The rig's current/previous points, derived geometry, keyframes and animation
buffers translate together. The native constraint/friction solver can correct rig
positions and velocity, including configured wall/floor constraints. This does not
create a hit or sweep collisions along the path. The API does not validate a safe
destination; native collision processing continues on subsequent steps. A stale round, body,
script session or dead fighter discards pending motion; pause retains it until
simulation resumes. There is no completion callback. See
[Create a movement ability](../../guides/fighter-motion/) for the complete example
and composition rules.

## fighter.opponent:move_by

Queue an additive displacement of the opposing main fighter.

**Signature:** `fighter.opponent:move_by(x, y, z?)`

**Returns:** `true, nil` for an accepted request; `false, reason` for native
rejection. Invalid arguments, missing capabilities, expired methods and forbidden
callback timing raise a Lua error. Acceptance does not guarantee application.

**When:** The same active simulation callbacks and offline fight eligibility as
`fighter:move_by`, with a living opposing main fighter. The opponent table may be
absent; check it before calling. Begin/end callbacks cannot move either fighter.

**Requires:** `combat.motion` and `combat.target`.

```lua
-- Inside an active combat callback:
if fighter.opponent then
    local accepted, reason = fighter.opponent:move_by(-60, 0, 0)
    if not accepted then sf2.log.warn(reason) end
end
```

The self method's coordinate, argument, displacement, request-count, deferred
application and lifetime limits also apply. The opponent shares its pending
queue with requests it receives through other behaviors. Moving both participants
requires two independent calls; they are not a transaction. A call cannot target
arbitrary child actors or retained fighters from earlier callbacks.

## fighter:play_move

Request explicit playback of an authored move on this main fighter.

**Signature:** `fighter:play_move(move)`

**Returns:** A `PlayMoveRequest` table with `status` (`"queued"`, `"applied"` or
`"failed"`) and optional `error`. Native rejection immediately returns `failed`;
accepted work starts `queued` and the host updates the receipt at its simulation
boundary. `applied` means playback started, not that the move completed or hit.
Invalid arguments, missing capabilities, expired references and forbidden
callback timing raise Lua errors.

**When:** Active simulation callbacks with a living main fighter in an offline
round. Unavailable in `on_fight_begin`, `on_round_begin`, `on_round_end`,
`on_fight_end`, while paused, in training/title sparring, local versus, legacy PvP
or online raids. Offline mod raids are eligible. Requests during the native
playback boundary reject to prevent recursive start/end chains.

**Requires:** `combat.animation`. `move` must be a handle returned by this mod's
`sf2.moves.register` or `sf2.moves.replace`; raw names, forged handles and another
script context's handles are rejected.

```lua
-- strike is a move handle registered by this script during loading.
-- Inside an active callback, request once when the ability activates:
local request = fighter:play_move(strike)
-- You may retain this receipt and poll it in later ticks, unlike fighter handles.
if request.status == "failed" then sf2.log.warn(request.error) end
```

The move must exist in the current fighter's native animation cache, which is
built for its rig/equipment/locks. Availability is checked at queuing and again
at application. This API deliberately uses explicit named playback, rather than
input/AI selection: it does **not** evaluate move selection events/conditions,
key bindings, priorities, cancel windows or player control restrictions. It can
interrupt a running animation. Native model readiness/physics checks still apply.
Define ability costs, readiness, cancellation and cooldown policy in Lua; add
attack windows, damage, effects and transitions to the declarative move. Test
the binary's rig compatibility. A cached move alone is not proof that it is
appropriate to play during every state.

Only one request per body can be pending in a simulation step, shared across
mods. The first accepted request wins; another returns a failed receipt without
overwriting it, even for the same move. Each participant has a separate slot.
An accepted request remains queued if its handler later raises an error; combat
operations are not a transaction.
The host applies motion first, then playback, after normal model/collision/
animation processing and before round arbitration/interpolation capture.
Snapshots inside the requesting callback still show the old animation.

Pause retains already queued work until simulation resumes. A dead/replaced/
detached body, unavailable move, stale round/session or round/fight teardown
fails its receipt and never replays the request. Native start failure also sets
`failed`, without suppressing the other participant's request. Receipt updates
do not invoke a Lua completion callback. The receipt is transient; do not persist
it in saved state. Editing its fields cannot control the host.

See [Active Strike](../../examples/#active-strike-trial) for a complete HUD ability
using a registered punch and an applied receipt before starting cooldown.

## fighter.opponent:play_move

Request explicit playback of a registered move on the opposing main fighter.

**Signature:** `fighter.opponent:play_move(move)`

**Returns:** A `PlayMoveRequest` with the same queued/applied/failed/error contract
as the self method. `applied` confirms startup only, not completion or damage.

**When:** The same active simulation callbacks and offline-round eligibility as
the self method, with a living opponent. Check that the opponent table exists;
begin/end callbacks cannot start a move on either participant.

**Requires:** `combat.animation` and `combat.target`; a registered move handle
owned by this script context.

```lua
-- Inside an active callback; reaction was registered during loading.
if fighter.opponent then
    local request = fighter.opponent:play_move(reaction)
    if request.status == "failed" then sf2.log.warn(request.error) end
end
```

All self-method availability, argument, explicit-selection, queue, receipt and
lifetime rules apply. The opponent's slot is shared with requests it receives
through its own behaviors. Two calls are independent, not an atomic pair; this
operation cannot address arbitrary child actors.
