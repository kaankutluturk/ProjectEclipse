title: Custom UI
description: Open owned layouts, update their widgets from Lua, and handle clicks safely.
---

Layout tables describe presentation; ordinary Lua
functions perform calculations and handle clicks. No expression strings or
operation lists are needed. A **view handle** identifies one live surface owned
by the script that created it. It is not save data and cannot be forged by
constructing a similar-looking table.

## Layout and lifetime

An open definition requires `id`, `mount`, and `root`. Optional `on_click` is a
Lua function with signature `function(view, widget_id)`; its return is ignored.
It runs on a button click with a bounded instruction budget. An error closes
that view and logs a diagnostic. It receives no fighter capability: change Lua
state and act through a fresh combat callback when gameplay authority is needed.

An optional [`on_close`](#on_close) lets you cancel
pending choices and release Lua references after a live view closes.

Mounts are `menu`, `modal`, and `hud`. Modals have priority over menus, then HUDs;
the newest view wins within a priority. Only the foreground view accepts input.
Menu/modal backdrops block pointer input outside their content and capture
keyboard/controller navigation. Back closes their foreground view. HUDs capture gameplay input while their foreground text field is being edited.
Otherwise they do not capture keyboard navigation automatically; their buttons
currently use pointer input. Opening any view **does not pause combat**.

Eclipse uses Unity's Input System for keyboard, mouse, touch and gamepad input.
Existing bindings retain their meanings. Gamepad buttons use their semantic
positions (A/Cross is south, B/Circle east, Y/Triangle north and X/Square west),
so mod UI follows the same controls as native menus. This does not add raw
device access to Lua or change click callbacks.

Layouts use a 1280×720 reference canvas and default to the center of the screen's
safe area. The open definition accepts an optional `placement`:

```lua
placement = { anchor = "top_right", x = -24, y = 104 },
```

`anchor` defaults to `center`; supported values are `top_left`, `top`,
`top_right`, `left`, `center`, `right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom`, and
`bottom_right`. The matching edge or corner of the root aligns with the safe
area. `x` and `y` default to zero and accept finite values from -8192 to 8192
in reference units. Positive `x` moves right; positive `y` moves down.
For example, the placement above leaves 24 units on the right and 104 at the top.

Oversized roots scale down uniformly. Offsets are clamped to keep the entire
root inside the safe area; resizing recalculates from the requested placement.
Placement is fixed for the lifetime of a view; close and reopen to change it.
Native
dialogs, the title screen and restart flow suspend mod UI. Closing a scene or
disposing its script closes the affected views. An ID can be reused after its
view closes, with fresh state. Limits: eight open views per script scope, 64
mounted views per scene, 256 nodes per view, and depth 16.

Each node is a table:

| Field | Required/default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Required | Unique within this view; 1–64 ASCII letters, digits, `_` or `-`. View IDs use the same syntax. |
| `kind` | Required | `stack`, `row`, `column`, `scroll`, `text`, `button`, `progress`, `toggle`, `slider`, `image`, `grid`, or `text_input`. |
| `width`, `height` | `0` | Finite 0–8192 reference units. Both must be positive on the root. Zero gives flexible size in a row/column; use explicit dimensions inside stacks. |
| `children` | Empty | Dense array of nodes. Only containers accept children; `scroll` requires exactly one content node. |
| `gap` | `0` | Row/column/grid spacing, finite 0–1024. Other kinds require zero. Grid uses this spacing on both axes. |
| `columns` | Required for grid | Integer 1–256, only on `grid`. Children fill each row from left to right. |
| `cell_width`, `cell_height` | Required for grid | Finite 1–8192 reference units, only on `grid`. The grid controls each direct child's size. |
| `text` | `""` | Text/button/toggle label or text input initial value, up to 8192 UTF-16 code units. Inputs also obey `max_chars`; other kinds require empty text. Plain text, wrapped and clipped; rich text is disabled. |
| `max_chars` | `128` | Text inputs only; integer 1–8192 UTF-16 code units. A surrogate pair (such as an emoji) takes two units. |
| `placeholder` | `""` | Text inputs only; plain hint text, up to 8192 UTF-16 code units. Shown while empty; never returned as the field value. |
| `multiline` | `false` | Text inputs only; boolean. True permits line breaks and Enter inserts a new line. |
| `value` | `0` | Progress/slider fraction, finite 0–1. Toggles reject this field; other kinds require zero. |
| `checked` | `false` | Boolean, toggles only. |
| `sprite` | Required for image | Typed handle from `sf2.assets.sprite`. Only image widgets accept this field. Images require positive width and height, preserve aspect ratio, and do not receive clicks. |
| `mirrored` | `false` | Boolean, images only. Reflects artwork horizontally around its center without changing layout dimensions, aspect ratio or the shared sprite asset. Fixed for the view's lifetime; sprite replacement preserves it. |
| `visible`, `enabled` | `true` | Widget state; hidden/disabled ancestors also prevent button activation. |
| `style` | Game defaults | Optional style table; see below. |

Rows and columns lay out their children in order; stacks center their children.
Scroll is vertical with clipped content. It uses the game's own list scrolling,
as in the shop and profile: drag with inertia, elastic edges that spring back,
mouse-wheel steps and keyboard/controller focus scrolling. A root stack can
request the original game scroll frame with `style = { frame = "scroll" }` on a
menu or modal. A scroll widget inside that frame also shows the same desktop
scrollbar as the shop and profile lists, hidden when its content fits. Default labels use the game font with
a fallback. Menu/modal surfaces use the original parchment background; buttons
use the native white beveled sprite and native button tints. Progress bars use
the recovered combat bar textures. HUD roots stay transparent. Keep custom UI
consistent with the game: prefer these shared defaults and use overrides for
readability or a specific semantic emphasis. Unknown fields, duplicate IDs, malformed arrays and invalid values
are errors. Dynamic text accepts plain strings. Use
[`sf2.localization.text`](../localization-patches/#sf2localizationtext) to resolve
translation handles during UI refreshes. Custom fonts and virtualized lists are not
supported yet.

### Editable text

Use `kind = "text_input"` for names, search boxes, seed entry, and other forms.
Fields use the native parchment artwork, game font and Unity text editing.
`text` is the initial value; `placeholder` is a hint. Single-line fields reject
line breaks. Multiline fields accept CR, LF and Unicode line/paragraph separators.
Tabs, other control characters, malformed UTF-16 and values over `max_chars` are
rejected. Script setters reject invalid values without changing the old value;
native editing enforces the limit and restores the previous valid value if an
edit violates the contract. These rules also apply to the initial value.

Click a field to edit. While editing, arrows, Space and Enter belong to text
editing; Tab/Shift+Tab move to another control. Back first leaves editing;
a subsequent Back dismisses a menu/modal or calls its `on_back`. Opening a
menu/modal may focus its first interactive field automatically. Hidden or
disabled ancestors, a foreground replacement, native dialogs and view closure
stop editing. A HUD captures fighter controls only while its field is focused;
a menu/modal captures them throughout. Combat continues unless your separate
workflow pauses it. Prefer a modal for a complete keyboard-operated form.

`on_change` receives a string after a user edit. Read the current value with
[`sf2.ui.get_text`](#sf2uiget_text), or set it silently with
[`sf2.ui.set_text`](#sf2uiset_text). Validate application-specific rules in Lua;
text input is not a numeric widget or a password field. The game font determines
which glyphs display; emoji rendering, physical keyboard/IME composition and
mobile software keyboards have not been accepted by the controlled Unity test.
Custom fonts are not supported.

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
sf2.ui.open {
    id = "name_form", mount = "modal",
    root = { id = "panel", kind = "column", width = 400, height = 104, gap = 8,
        children = {
            { id = "name", kind = "text_input", height = 48,
              placeholder = "Fighter name", max_chars = 24 },
            { id = "apply", kind = "button", height = 48, text = "Apply" },
        } },
    on_click = function(view, id)
        if id == "apply" then
            local name = sf2.ui.get_text(view, "name")
            if name ~= "" then sf2.log.info("Chosen name: " .. name) end
        end
    end,
}
```

For a complete combat example, enable **Text Input Lab**
(`Mods/example.text-input-lab`), restart, and enter Tournament 3 in normal or
Eclipse mode. It provides a HUD name field and a multiline introduction modal.
Names and introductions remain in Lua memory; the example does not rename the
native fighter or write a save.

### Grid layouts

For a ready-to-open test, enable **Grid UI Showcase** (`example.grid-ui`) from
`Mods/example.grid-ui`, restart Eclipse and enter the map, shop, profile or dojo.
Its modal opens automatically; there is no map battle to select. It contains
twelve sample equipment buttons in three columns, scrolling, a selected-name
label and HIDE BLADE / DISABLE SPEAR controls. BACK or Escape closes it; enter
another non-combat scene to reopen. Disable other auto-opening UI examples while
testing. It selects labels only and does not change equipment or saves.

Fixed-column grids arrange widgets for equipment, character and reward selectors.
A grid arranges existing widgets, so buttons and labels retain the original game
sprites and font. A cell may also be a column or stack containing artwork and a
button. Direct child widths/heights are overridden by the grid's cell dimensions;
image nodes still require positive authored dimensions.

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
local names = { "Blade", "Spear", "Staff", "Claws", "Knives", "Axe" }
local cells = {}
for i, name in ipairs(names) do
    cells[i] = { id = "option_" .. i, kind = "button", text = name }
end
sf2.ui.open {
    id = "equipment_choices", mount = "modal",
    root = { id = "panel", kind = "column", width = 460, height = 220,
        gap = 12, children = {
            { id = "selection", kind = "text", width = 460, height = 40,
              text = "Choose equipment" },
            { id = "options", kind = "grid", width = 460, height = 108,
              columns = 3, cell_width = 148, cell_height = 48, gap = 6,
              children = cells },
        },
    },
    on_click = function(view, id)
        local index = tonumber(id:match("^option_(%d+)$"))
        if index then sf2.ui.set_text(view, "selection", names[index]) end
    end,
}
```

This example selects a label; it does not grant or equip an item. Use the selected
value in your own supported workflow. Children appear in their authored order,
starting at the upper left. Hidden children leave the layout and later cells move
forward; disabled children keep their place. Set enough grid height for all rows:
`rows * cell_height + math.max(0, rows - 1) * gap`, where
`rows = math.ceil(#cells / columns)`. Width follows the same formula with columns.
Grid dimensions do not grow automatically. Put a tall grid inside a `scroll` node
for clipping and scrolling; grids by themselves do not clip overflowing children.

Tab visits interactive descendants in row order; Shift+Tab reverses that order.
Arrows, the D-pad and the left stick navigate grids by their visible layout:
Left/Right stay on the current row and Up/Down prefer overlapping columns.
Hidden and disabled controls are skipped. Directional grid navigation does not
wrap at an edge; use Tab to reach controls outside that direction. Controls outside
the grid can be reached when they lie in the requested direction. Outside grids,
Up/Down retain ordered traversal. Left/Right adjust a selected slider, including
when it is inside a grid; reaching the slider's endpoint does not move focus away.
Focus reveals its control inside vertical scroll containers. Grids retain the
256-node limit for the entire view, including nested cell contents; virtualized
collections are not implemented.

### Image widgets

Requires the usual `ui.create` capability. Put a PNG at
`assets/sprites/reward.png` in your mod, then obtain its sprite handle. Replace
`example.my-mod` with your manifest's ID:

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
local artwork = sf2.assets.sprite("example.my-mod:sprites/reward")
local view = sf2.ui.open {
    id = "reward_preview", mount = "modal",
    root = { id = "paper", kind = "column", width = 400, height = 240,
        children = {
            { id = "art", kind = "image", width = 360, height = 160,
              sprite = artwork },
            { id = "caption", kind = "text", width = 360, height = 40,
              text = "Your reward" },
        },
    },
}
```

The sprite fits inside its rectangle without stretching or cropping. Use the
shared parchment container and game-font caption to keep the presentation
consistent. Images are decorative: they accept neither text, values, children,
nor style overrides. Put any background on their parent. [`sf2.ui.set_sprite`](#sf2uiset_sprite) replaces artwork in place. Visibility and enabled
state use the existing UI functions. Closing a view does not destroy shared
loader-owned artwork. A missing or unloadable sprite fails mounting and closes
the surface rather than leaving a white missing-image rectangle.

Sprite handles retain the existing asset dependency and ownership checks. Raw
paths, strings in `sprite`, forged handles, and Unity objects are not accepted.
Automated Lua/runtime checks cover this contract; native rendering acceptance is
tracked separately from editor diagnostics.

Toggles use the original checkbox sprites, and sliders use
the original settings track, fill and handle. In a menu/modal, Up/Down or Tab
moves focus, Enter/Space (controller A) toggles the selected checkbox, and
Left/Right (D-pad or stick) adjusts the selected slider in steps of 0.05.
Pointer dragging is continuous. HUD controls accept pointer input.
An optional [`on_change`](#on_change) callback receives actual user changes;
programmatic setters never trigger it. Text styles also apply to toggle labels,
and `fill_color` applies to sliders. Map normalized slider values to meaningful
units in ordinary Lua, for example `seconds = 10 + value * 50`.

## sf2.ui.set_checked

The checkmark reflects the authored `checked` value from the initial mount,
including unchecked toggles. Programmatic changes update the checkmark immediately.

**Signature:** `sf2.ui.set_checked(view, widget_id, checked)`

**Returns:** Nothing.

**When:** Set a toggle's boolean state without triggering `on_change`.

**Requires:** An open owned view and a toggle ID. No additional capability.

```lua
sf2.ui.set_checked(view, "challenge", true)
```

## on_change

**Signature:** `on_change = function(view, widget_id, value) ... end`

**Returns:** Ignored.

**When:** A visible, enabled toggle, slider or text input in the foreground view changes
through user input. `value` is a boolean for toggles, a number from 0 to 1 for
sliders, and a string for text inputs. The new value is committed before notification. Repeated identical
values and programmatic setters do not notify. Hidden/disabled ancestors and
native dialogs block input. A callback may update widgets or close its view.

**Requires:** `ui.create` to open the view. No fighter authority is
supplied. The callback has a 200,000-instruction budget; failure closes the view
and logs an error. Already committed Lua or saved state is not rolled back.

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
local challenge, duration = false, 30
sf2.ui.open {
    id = "options", mount = "menu",
    root = { id = "root", kind = "column", width = 400, height = 160,
        children = {
            { id = "challenge", kind = "toggle", width = 400, height = 48,
              text = "Challenge rules", checked = challenge },
            { id = "duration", kind = "slider", width = 400, height = 48, value = 0.4 },
        },
    },
    on_change = function(_, widget_id, value)
        if widget_id == "challenge" then challenge = value
        elseif widget_id == "duration" then duration = 10 + value * 50 end
    end,
}
```

## Widget styles

Each node accepts an optional `style` table. Styles are immutable
for the view's lifetime, do not inherit, and preserve game defaults when omitted.
They affect presentation only; they do not enable rich text or change input rules.

| Field | Default | Applies to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `font_size` | `22` | Text/buttons/toggles/text inputs; integer 8–128 reference units. Does not enlarge the layout box. |
| `text_align` | `center` | Text/buttons/toggles/text inputs; `left`, `center`, or `right`; labels are vertically centered, multiline inputs start at the top. Inputs default to left alignment. |
| `text_color` | Native dark text on parchment/buttons; pale gold on HUD labels | Text/buttons/toggles/text inputs. |
| `background_color` | Native sprite colors | Containers, buttons, toggles, progress and slider tracks. Use a container behind text. |
| `fill_color` | Native combat bar colors | Progress widgets and sliders. |
| `frame` | No extra frame | `scroll` on a menu/modal root `stack` only. Uses the profile scroll's paper for the root area, with torn sides hanging about 55 units outside the left and right edges and 74-unit rolls overlapping the top and bottom. Nothing opaque is drawn outside the paper and roll artwork. A nested vertical scroll gets the desktop scrollbar. Inset content at least 75 units from the top and bottom; it may use the full width. |

Colors must be `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA` hex strings (case-insensitive); omitted
alpha means opaque. Sprite colors are multiplicative tints, so a color does not
replace the texture's shading. Buttons additionally apply their native hover,
pressed and disabled tints. Container backgrounds use parchment and do not add
pointer blocking. An explicit transparent color does not disable button input;
use `enabled` or `visible` for that. Unknown fields and styles on incompatible
widget kinds raise an error.

```lua
-- A title node inside a parchment menu; retain the native font and colors.
{ id = "title", kind = "text", width = 400, height = 48,
  text = "Battle rules", style = { font_size = 30, text_align = "left" } }
```

For a scroll-framed chooser, center a smaller content column inside a root
stack, leaving space for the original roll art. For example, a 580×630 root
can contain a 520×480 column with a title, `scroll` widget and close button;
the scrollbar takes the scroll widget's rightmost 20 units.
The scroll content must be taller than its viewport to move; use a fixed-height
grid or column inside it. To let players choose a dojo, you do not need to build this yourself:
[`sf2.locations.dojo_picker`](../locations-and-locales/#sf2locationsdojo_picker)
declares a ready-made, animated picker.

Text still wraps and clips within its authored dimensions. Provide enough width
and height for translations and larger text. These options do not expose custom
fonts, materials, arbitrary stylesheets or replacement of the shared game skin.

## sf2.ui.open

**Signature:** `sf2.ui.open(definition)`

**Returns:** An owned view handle, or raises an error if validation/mounting fails.

**When:** During script execution or callbacks with an available game UI host.
Scene changes close the resulting view; create it from the relevant lifecycle
callback when it must appear in a particular scene. Opening on every tick is
unnecessary: keep a handle and update individual widgets.

**Requires:** `ui.create` in the manifest.

```lua
local count = 0
local view = sf2.ui.open {
    id = "counter", mount = "menu",
    root = { id = "root", kind = "column", width = 320, height = 96, gap = 8,
        children = {
            { id = "count", kind = "text", width = 320, height = 40, text = "0" },
            { id = "add", kind = "button", width = 320, height = 48, text = "Add one" },
        },
    },
    on_click = function(current, widget_id)
        if widget_id == "add" then
            count = count + 1
            sf2.ui.set_text(current, "count", tostring(count))
        end
    end,
}
```

## sf2.ui.close

**Signature:** `sf2.ui.close(view)`

**Returns:** Nothing.

**When:** When the view is no longer needed, including inside its click handler.
Closing an already closed valid handle is harmless. Close removes presentation
and input ownership; it does not reset your gameplay variables.

**Requires:** A view handle from this script context; no additional capability.

```lua
sf2.ui.close(view)
```

## sf2.ui.is_open

**Signature:** `sf2.ui.is_open(view)`

**Returns:** `true` while open, otherwise `false`.

**When:** Before an update when Back, scene exit or a callback error may have
closed the view. An invalid or foreign handle raises an error, rather than false.

**Requires:** A view handle from this script context; no additional capability.

```lua
if view and sf2.ui.is_open(view) then sf2.ui.set_text(view, "count", "Ready") end
```

## sf2.ui.get_text

**Signature:** `sf2.ui.get_text(view, widget_id)`

**Returns:** The current plain string, including `""` for an empty value.

**When:** Read a text input on Apply/Submit, or inspect a text/button/toggle label.
During `on_change`, the getter already returns the newly committed value.
It returns an input's value, never its placeholder. Hidden and disabled widgets
can still be read by their owner.

**Requires:** An open owned view and a text/button/toggle/text_input ID; no
additional capability. Unknown IDs, other widget kinds, closed or forged view
handles, and argument counts other than two are errors.

```lua
-- view is an open owned form with a text_input named "name".
local name = sf2.ui.get_text(view, "name")
if name == "" then sf2.log.info("Please enter a name") end
```

## sf2.ui.set_text

**Signature:** `sf2.ui.set_text(view, widget_id, text)`

**Returns:** Nothing.

**When:** Update a text, button or toggle label, or replace a text input value without
triggering `on_change`. Input values also obey their `max_chars`, multiline and
valid-text rules. Invalid values leave the old value intact. The string may be empty and is limited
to 8192 UTF-16 code units. Updates do not rebuild the layout tree.

**Requires:** An open owned view and a text/button/toggle/text_input ID; no additional capability.

```lua
sf2.ui.set_text(view, "count", "Charge: " .. tostring(charge))
```

## sf2.ui.set_sprite

**Signature:** `sf2.ui.set_sprite(view, widget_id, sprite)`

**Returns:** `nil`.

**When:** After opening a surface, including from its click/change callbacks. Use
this to switch a character portrait, equipment icon or reward preview without
rebuilding the panel.

**Requires:** An open UI handle and a sprite handle created by the same script
context. The widget must be an `image`. Its size, aspect-preserving rendering,
visibility and place in the layout stay unchanged. `ui.create` is required to
create the surface; the setter grants no additional asset access.

```lua
local alternate = sf2.assets.sprite("example.selector:sprites/alternate")
-- view contains an image node whose id is "portrait".
sf2.ui.set_sprite(view, "portrait", alternate)
```

Strings, forged handles, other asset kinds, unknown widget IDs and closed views
are rejected. Assigning the current sprite again does nothing. The renderer loads
the replacement through the asset host; a missing or invalid image closes the
surface with reason `error` and reports the failure, following the normal UI
cleanup rules. Replacing an image never destroys loader-owned sprites used by
other views. To hide artwork, use `sf2.ui.set_visible`; `nil` is not a sprite.

## sf2.ui.set_value

**Signature:** `sf2.ui.set_value(view, widget_id, value)`

**Returns:** Nothing.

**When:** Change a progress widget's fill or a slider's position to a finite fraction from 0 to 1.
Invalid values are rejected before mutation.

**Requires:** An open owned view and a progress/slider ID; no additional capability. Setters do not invoke `on_change`.

```lua
sf2.ui.set_value(view, "meter", math.min(1, charge / maximum))
```

## sf2.ui.set_visible

**Signature:** `sf2.ui.set_visible(view, widget_id, visible)`

**Returns:** Nothing.

**When:** Show/hide a widget or subtree using a boolean. Hiding the root releases
its foreground input priority; showing it restores its original ordering.

**Requires:** An open owned view and a valid widget ID; no additional capability.

```lua
sf2.ui.set_visible(view, "details", show_details)
```

## sf2.ui.set_enabled

**Signature:** `sf2.ui.set_enabled(view, widget_id, enabled)`

**Returns:** Nothing.

**When:** Enable/disable interaction using a boolean. A disabled ancestor prevents
its descendants from activating. Disabling a root does not close its modal backdrop.

**Requires:** An open owned view and a valid widget ID; no additional capability.

```lua
sf2.ui.set_enabled(view, "arm", charge >= 1 and not armed)
```

The [Charged Strike example](https://github.com/dawc17/ProjectEclipse/tree/main/ArchivedMods/example.charge-ui)
combines a live HUD, a click handler, simulation ticks and a fresh outgoing-hit
callback. Managed Lua and isolated Unity fixtures cover these components; full
gameplay, physical input and visual acceptance remain pending.


## sf2.ui.dojo_button

**Signature:** `sf2.ui.dojo_button { id = "...", image = sprite }`

**Returns:** The button's qualified name, `<mod-id>.<id>`, as a string.

**When:** During loading, like other registrations. The button is added to the
game's side menu whenever the dojo is the current screen. It sits below the
disciple button's slot, whether or not the player has unlocked the disciple
yet. Buttons from several mods stack downward in load order.

**Requires:** `content.register`. `id` (required) is 1–64 lowercase ASCII
letters, digits, `_` or `-`, unique within the mod. `image` (required) is a
sprite handle from `sf2.assets.sprite`; the button uses the sprite's size,
scaled down if it would be larger than the disciple button. A mod can register
at most 4 dojo buttons. Nothing is saved to the profile: removing the mod or
the registration removes the button. React to clicks with
[`sf2.story.on("dojo_button", ...)`](../story/#sf2storyon), which needs
`story.events`.

```lua
local name = sf2.ui.dojo_button { id = "wardrobe",
    image = sf2.assets.sprite("sprites/wardrobe_button") }

sf2.story.on("dojo_button", function(event)
    if event.button == name then
        -- Open an owned UI view here (requires ui.create).
    end
end)
```

A missing or unloadable image is logged and that button is skipped; the rest
of the menu keeps working.

For a dojo selector, [`sf2.locations.dojo_picker`](../locations-and-locales/#sf2locationsdojo_picker)
registers the button and a ready-made picker in one declaration.

## on_click

Handle a button activation in the view that owns it.

**Signature:** `on_click = function(view, widget_id) ... end`

**Returns:** Ignored.

**When:** An enabled, visible button in the foreground view is activated.

**Requires:** `ui.create` to open the view; no fighter authority is supplied.

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
sf2.ui.open {
    id = "choice", mount = "menu",
    root = { id = "cancel", kind = "button", width = 240, height = 48, text = "Back" },
    on_click = function(view, widget_id)
        if widget_id == "cancel" then sf2.ui.close(view) end
    end,
}
```

`widget_id` is the button's declared ID, not its label. Hiding/disabling an
ancestor prevents activation. The callback has a 200,000-instruction budget;
an error closes this view and is logged. Updating widgets and closing the view
inside the callback is supported. Use normal Lua state to pass a choice to a
later supported gameplay callback. This callback cannot itself launch fights
or acquire a fighter handle.

## on_back

**Signature:** `on_back = function(view) ... end`

**Returns:** Nothing; callback return values are ignored.

**When:** The user presses Back/Escape on the foreground menu or modal while
native input is available. This replaces the default Back close. Close the view
explicitly on success; leave it open if an operation must be retried. HUD views
do not receive Back. Scene changes, profile replacement, script unload and other
cleanup never invoke this callback.

**Requires:** `ui.create` to open the view, plus any capabilities used inside the
callback. It uses the same bounded execution and reentrancy guards as `on_click`.
A callback error or instruction-budget overrun closes the view with `error`.

```lua
local function acknowledge(view)
    -- Requires story.progression; this notification belongs on the story map.
    if sf2.profile.set_eclipse_mode(false) then sf2.ui.close(view) end
end
sf2.ui.open {
    id = "map_notice", mount = "modal",
    root = { id = "ok", kind = "button", width = 240, height = 60, text = "OK" },
    on_click = function(view) acknowledge(view) end,
    on_back = acknowledge,
}
```

Omitting `on_back` keeps the default close with reason `back`. Calling
`sf2.ui.close` inside the callback closes with reason `script`. Use `on_close`
for releasing references; keep acknowledgments in user-input callbacks so
navigation or profile teardown cannot accidentally advance a quest.

## on_close

Clear pending choices or Lua references when a view closes. Set this optional function in the table passed to `sf2.ui.open`.

**Signature:** `on_close = function(view, reason) ... end`

**Returns:** Ignored.

**When:** Once after a successfully mounted view closes and its renderer and
input ownership have been released, while its script context is still alive.

**Requires:** `ui.create` to open the view. State operations retain their own
capability and loaded-profile requirements; no fighter authority is supplied.

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
local chooser
local pending_choice
local function show_choice()
    chooser = sf2.ui.open {
        id = "choice", mount = "menu",
        root = { id = "cancel", kind = "button", width = 240, height = 48, text = "Back" },
        on_click = function(view) sf2.ui.close(view) end,
        on_close = function(view, reason)
            if chooser == view then chooser = nil end
            pending_choice = nil
            sf2.log.debug("Chooser closed: " .. reason)
        end,
    }
end
show_choice()
```

Default widgets retain the game font, parchment and native button styling.
For a complete HUD example, Charged Strike cancels its armed bonus when its
view closes. It explicitly patches both `core:fights/zone_1/tournament/3` and
`core:fights/zone_1/tournament_eclipsemode/3`: allowing a rule in both modes does
not attach it to a separate native battle automatically.

| `reason` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `script` | Lua called `sf2.ui.close`, or the host explicitly closed/disposed this surface. |
| `back` | Back/Escape/controller Back dismissed the foreground menu or modal. |
| `scene` | The owning scene's UI layer stack was disposed. |
| `error` | A click or renderer update failed. |
| `destroyed` | The native view was destroyed externally while still open. |

The first close wins: repeated closes do not notify again. Scene teardown may
report `scene` or `destroyed`, depending on which native component closes first.
Within `on_close`, `sf2.ui.is_open(view)` is false. Closing it again is harmless;
widget setters fail because it no longer has live widgets.

Notification has a 200,000-instruction budget. Errors are logged and cannot
prevent the completed teardown. Opening another UI surface inside any
`on_close` callback is rejected, including after closing another view. This
prevents a cancellation callback from rebuilding a menu during scene teardown.
Open subsequent menus from a later supported callback, or after `sf2.ui.close`
returns to the caller. Other live views may be updated or closed.

No notification runs for failed mounting, script shutdown, failed entrypoint
cleanup or a disposed owner scope. Native cleanup still runs. Do not depend on
`on_close` to grant rewards, persist a final result or run shutdown logic.
Successful state writes before a later callback error are not rolled back.
## sf2.ui.act_screen

**Signature:** `sf2.ui.act_screen(definition) -> boolean`

**Returns:** `true` when the native act screen starts; `false` when another presentation or a map transition/input lock prevents it. Invalid arguments, a missing capability, or a host without presentation support raise an error.

**When:** On the active progression map with a bound profile. It cannot open from a UI cleanup callback. Only one act screen runs at a time.

**Requires:** `ui.create`. Registering localization also requires `content.register`.

The required `lines` is a dense array of 1–32 tables. Each requires `text`, a localization handle from this script context, and `frames`, an integer from 1–3600 at 60 frames per second. Total text duration may not exceed 7200 frames. Native fades add to that duration. Text resolves in the current language when requested and must contain 1–4096 characters; it is displayed literally, without alias, parameter, or rich-text interpretation. Unknown fields are rejected.

The native screen controls fades and act music. It holds a silent input lock, including mod UI, without releasing other owners' locks. Scene/profile changes, restart, script disposal, or destruction cancel it, restore presentation resources, and do **not** invoke `on_complete`. A refused request is not queued: retry from an appropriate later event. The optional completion callback takes no arguments.

```lua
local ending = sf2.localization.register {
    id = "ending", language = "eng", value = "The journey continues."
}
-- Invoke from your map story handler, after dialogue has closed.
local accepted = sf2.ui.act_screen {
    lines = {{text = ending, frames = 180}},
    on_complete = function() sf2.log.info("Ending finished") end
}
```

## sf2.ui.story_dialog

Show one of the game's own story dialogs: the parchment popup with a speaker
title, a round portrait, text and a single button that quest dialogs use.

**Signature:** `sf2.ui.story_dialog(definition) -> boolean`

**Returns:** `true` when the native dialog opens; `false` when this script
already has a story dialog open, or the host refuses (no bound profile, a
scene/profile change in progress, the title screen or a restart). Invalid
arguments, a missing capability, or a host without dialog support raise an
error.

**When:** From a story, UI or fight-entry callback after the profile has loaded.
It cannot open from a UI cleanup callback. One story dialog per script is open
at a time; open the next one from `on_complete`.

**Requires:** `ui.create`. Registering localization also requires `content.register`.

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `portrait` | Sprite handle | No portrait | Speaker portrait, shown the same way as core portraits (512 × 512 art matches them). Omit it for an announcement without a speaker; the dialog then hides the portrait. |
| `lines` | Array of line tables | Required | 1–16 pages shown in order. Each needs `text` (localization handle) and may set `button` (localization handle for that page's "more" button). |
| `button` | Localization handle | Required | Caption of the final button, for example "OK" or "FIGHT". |
| `title` | Localization handle | No title | Speaker name. |
| `mirrored` | Boolean | `false` | Flip the portrait horizontally. |
| `ignore_back` | Boolean | `false` | Ignore the device Back key, so only the button closes the dialog. |
| `on_complete` | Function | None | Runs once when the player presses the final button (or Back, unless `ignore_back`). |
| `on_cancel` | Function | None | Runs once if the dialog is closed without that choice. |

Text is looked up by the game when the dialog is shown, so it follows the
current language. Use localization handles, not plain strings; core handles from
`sf2.localization.key` work too. Arrays must be dense, and unknown fields are
rejected.

The dialog belongs to the scene and profile that opened it. Changing scene or
profile, restarting, returning to the title screen or disposing the script
closes it and runs `on_cancel` instead of `on_complete`. Exactly one of the two
callbacks runs, at most once. A refused request is not queued: try again from a
later event such as the next `scene_enter`.

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
local name = sf2.localization.register { id = "sensei.name", language = "eng", value = "SENSEI" }
local line = sf2.localization.register { id = "sensei.hello", language = "eng", value = "Welcome back." }
local ok = sf2.localization.register { id = "ok", language = "eng", value = "OK" }
local face = sf2.assets.sprite("sprites/sensei")

sf2.story.on("scene_enter", function(event)
    if event.scene ~= "map" then return end
    sf2.ui.story_dialog {
        title = name, portrait = face, lines = { { text = line } }, button = ok,
        on_complete = function() sf2.log.info("Player read the greeting") end,
        on_cancel = function() sf2.log.info("Greeting interrupted; show it again later") end,
    }
end)
```

Callbacks run after the native dialog has closed. Chain a conversation by
opening the next dialog from `on_complete`:

```lua
-- cards is an array of { title = handle, text = handle }; face and ok as above.
local function show(index)
    local card = cards[index]
    if not card then return end
    sf2.ui.story_dialog {
        title = card.title, portrait = face, lines = { { text = card.text } }, button = ok,
        on_complete = function() show(index + 1) end,
    }
end
show(1)
```

## on_cancel

**Signature:** `on_cancel() -> nil`

**Returns:** Nothing; the return value is ignored.

**When:** Once, when a story dialog opened by `sf2.ui.story_dialog` closes
without the player's choice: a scene or profile change, restart, return to the
title screen, or script disposal. It never runs after `on_complete`. Exceptions
and instruction-budget failures are logged.

**Requires:** An accepted `sf2.ui.story_dialog` request with `ui.create`.

```lua
-- face, line and ok are handles created earlier.
local pending = true
sf2.ui.story_dialog {
    portrait = face, lines = { { text = line } }, button = ok,
    on_complete = function() pending = false end,
    on_cancel = function() sf2.log.info("Will show the message again on the next map visit") end,
}
```

## on_complete

**Signature:** `on_complete() -> nil`

**Returns:** Nothing; the return value is ignored.

**When:** Once after every line and the final native fade finish, with presentation resources and this screen's input locks already released. Cancellation/refusal never calls it. Exceptions and instruction-budget failures are logged.

**Requires:** An accepted `sf2.ui.act_screen` request with `ui.create`. `sf2.ui.story_dialog` uses the same callback name when the player presses its final button (or Back); see that section.

```lua
-- ending is a localization handle registered earlier.
sf2.ui.act_screen {
    lines = {{text = ending, frames = 180}},
    on_complete = function()
        sf2.log.info("Safe to continue the story")
    end
}
```
