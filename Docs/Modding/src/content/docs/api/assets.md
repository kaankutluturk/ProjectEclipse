description: Find assets, create typed sprite, model, audio, and animation handles, and understand asset IDs.
---

An **asset** is a file your mod uses, such as an icon, model, sound, or animation.
All examples assume `local sf2 = require("sf2")` at the top of your script.
Paths below are logical IDs: omit the final file extension. A path without a
namespace belongs to your mod. To use another mod's assets, declare that mod as
a dependency and prefix the path with its ID, for example `core:`.

Asset handles identify existing content; they do not let Lua edit Unity objects.
An invalid path or undeclared dependency is an error, even in `exists`.

## sf2.assets.qualify

Turn a local asset path into its complete namespaced ID. This is useful in logs.

**Signature:** `sf2.assets.qualify(reference)`

**Requires:** No capability. Cross-mod references require a declared dependency.

**When:** Entrypoint or a callback.

**Returns:** A normalized string. It does not check whether the asset exists.

`reference` is a nonempty asset ID string. Absolute filesystem paths and traversal
segments such as `..` are not valid asset references.

```lua
local full_id = sf2.assets.qualify("sprites/weapon")
sf2.log.info(full_id) -- my.mod:sprites/weapon when the manifest ID is my.mod
```

## sf2.assets.exists

Check whether an asset ID is available before choosing it.

**Signature:** `sf2.assets.exists(reference)`

**Requires:** No capability; the referenced owner must be your mod or a dependency.

**When:** Entrypoint or a callback.

**Returns:** `true` if the asset is described by the resolver, otherwise `false`.
It does not guarantee successful image decoding or that the asset has the type
you want. Malformed or unauthorized references raise an error.

```lua
if sf2.assets.exists("sprites/optional_badge") then
    sf2.log.info("Optional badge found")
end
```

## sf2.assets.sprite

Get a sprite handle for an item icon, achievement, location image, battle preview or opponent portrait.

**Signature:** `sf2.assets.sprite(reference)`

**Requires:** No capability; cross-mod references require a dependency.

**When:** Usually during registration, before passing the handle to a definition.

**Returns:** A sprite handle. Missing assets and assets of another type raise errors.

```lua
local icon = sf2.assets.sprite("sprites/weapon")
-- Requires assets/sprites/weapon.asset and its referenced PNG.
```

See the [sprite file format](../sprites-and-textures/) for crops, pivots, filtering,
and atlas references. A PNG texture ID is not interchangeable with a sprite ID.

## sf2.assets.model

Get a model handle for equipment from a core asset or local geometry.

**Signature:** `sf2.assets.model(reference)`

**Requires:** No capability; cross-mod references require a dependency.

**When:** Usually during registration.

**Returns:** A model handle. The asset must exist and be classified as a model;
local models can use `.xml` or `.modelz`.

```lua
local model = sf2.assets.model("core:gamedata/models/mdl_weapon_katana_ritual")
```

Using a known core model is the easiest starting point. The model, equipment
category, and combat subtype must make sense together; a valid ID alone does
not prove that a custom model will look or animate correctly.

For a local model, put native model geometry at `assets/models/<name>.xml`, or
gzip those UTF-8 bytes to `assets/models/<name>.modelz`. Both files use the ID
`models/<name>` without an extension. `.modelz` keeps the package binary while
the engine decodes the same model geometry; it does not turn gameplay XML into
mod definitions. The decoded model is limited to 64 MiB. For example, this
authoring command creates a reproducible compressed model:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import gzip

source = Path("my-model.xml").read_bytes()
Path("assets/models/my-model.modelz").write_bytes(gzip.compress(source, mtime=0))
```

Use `sf2.assets.model("models/my-model")` for either form. The editor indexes
the file and its kind; the game checks decoding and model compatibility when it
loads the geometry.

For an authored warrior body or skin, loading includes the
[character geometry checks](../../guides/character-authoring/#geometry-checks-when-the-game-loads-your-character).
They validate composed point/edge references and report the offending XML field.
Core assets retain legacy parsing. The character export tool's 16 MiB source
limit is stricter than the general model decoder's 64 MiB limit.

## sf2.assets.audio

Get an audio handle for location, battle or fight music, a move's sound action,
or a triggered screen effect's `sound`, or an owned [audio instance](../audio/).

**Signature:** `sf2.assets.audio(reference)`

**Requires:** No capability; cross-mod references require a dependency.

**When:** During registration before using the handle.

**Returns:** An audio handle. Missing or non-audio assets raise an error.

```lua
local music = sf2.assets.audio("audio/arena")
-- For example, a supported WAV file at assets/audio/arena.wav.
```

This only resolves the asset. To hear it, attach it to a location, a battle or
fight `music` field, a supported sound action, or the `sound` of a triggered
[`sf2.fx.screen`](../visuals/#sf2fxscreen), or pass it to
[`sf2.audio.play`](../audio/#sf2audioplay) from a runtime callback. The asset
handle itself has no playback methods; the audio API returns a separate instance.

## sf2.assets.binary

Get a binary asset handle for an animation supplied to `sf2.moves.register`.

**Signature:** `sf2.assets.binary(reference)`

**Requires:** No capability; cross-mod references require a dependency.

**When:** During registration.

**Returns:** A binary handle. An asset of another kind is rejected.

```lua
local animation = sf2.assets.binary("animations/opening")
-- Supply an actual animation file in the runtime's supported binary format.
```

A binary handle does not decode, convert, or validate every animation structure.
Renaming an arbitrary file will not turn it into an animation. The
[move reference](../moves-and-tactics/) explains where this handle is used.

For global swaps, see [`sf2.assets.replace`](../asset-replacement/#sf2assetsreplace).
There is no public Lua texture constructor; sprite descriptors reference textures.
