title: Reusable behaviors
description: Register Lua callbacks, configure typed parameters, and keep state for a round, fight, or saved effect.
---

A **behavior** is reusable Lua logic. A perk, enchantment, battle rule, or independent actor attaches
it to a fighter and supplies its configuration. Registering a behavior by itself
does not activate it; attach it using the [perk or enchantment functions](../perks-and-enchantments/)
or [a behavior rule](../rules/#sf2rulesbehavior), or pass it to an
[actor definition](../actors/#give-each-actor-its-own-reactive-logic).

## sf2.behaviors.register

Register a behavior with one or more supported combat callbacks.

**Signature:** `sf2.behaviors.register { id, parameters?, state?, on_event = function, ... }`

**Requires:** `content.register`. Operations performed by callbacks may require
additional capabilities such as `combat.magic_charge`.

**When:** Entrypoint, before registering perks, enchantments, or rules that use it.

**Returns:** A behavior handle.

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | String | Required | Stable local behavior ID. |
| `parameters` | Schema table | Empty | Typed configuration supplied by each attachment. |
| `state` | State specification | Omitted | Opt in to instance state and the `self` callback form. |
| Supported `on_*` names | Lua functions | At least one required | See the [callback reference](../combat-callbacks/). |

```lua
local opening_charge = sf2.behaviors.register {
    id = "opening_charge",
    parameters = { amount = sf2.behaviors.NUMBER },
    on_fight_begin = function(parameters, fighter, event)
        fighter:add_magic_charge(parameters.amount)
    end,
}
```

This example needs `combat.magic_charge` when the callback runs. A perk or
enchantment using it supplies `parameters = { amount = 0.35 }`.

## Parameter schema

The constants `sf2.behaviors.NUMBER`, `INTEGER`, `BOOLEAN`, and `STRING` have
the same bounds as [saved state fields](../mod-state/). Up to 64 parameters are
allowed. The short form `amount = sf2.behaviors.NUMBER` means a required number
with no default. The long form makes defaults explicit:

```lua
parameters = {
    amount = { type = sf2.behaviors.NUMBER, required = true, default = 0.35 },
    label = { type = sf2.behaviors.STRING, required = false },
}
```

Missing required parameters, unknown parameter names, and wrong types are
rejected. The attached perk/enchantment supplies values; the behavior supplies
the schema and functions.

## Instance state and callback arguments

Without `state`, callbacks receive `(parameters, fighter, event)`.
Declaring `state` changes that to `(self, fighter, event)`:

```lua
local ward = sf2.behaviors.register {
    id = "opening_ward",
    parameters = { multiplier = sf2.behaviors.NUMBER },
    state = {
        lifetime = "round",
        fields = {
            ready = { type = sf2.behaviors.BOOLEAN, default = true },
        },
    },
    on_damage_resolving = function(self, fighter, event)
        if self.state.ready and event.damage > 0 then
            fighter:scale_incoming_damage(self.params.multiplier)
            self.state.ready = false
        end
    end,
}
```

Attach this behavior with `parameters = { multiplier = 0.5 }` and declare
`combat.modify_hit`. It halves the first positive incoming hit of each round.

| State field | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fields` | Empty schema | Typed values; required fields must have defaults. |
| `lifetime` | `"fight"` | `"round"`, `"fight"`, or `"saved"`. |
| `version` | `1` | Positive schema version for saved instance state. |
| `migrations` | Empty | Old-version functions that upgrade primitive state values. |

`self.params` contains resolved configuration; `self.state` contains copied
state for this particular active effect. Round state resets for a new round;
fight state resets for a new fight. Saved state follows a player's individual
equipped enchantment or learned perk and is persisted by the normal save path.
NPC, battle-rule and actor instances support round and fight state, not saved state.
Actor instances are separate for every spawn, including repeated copies of one
definition. They receive actor spawn/end, tick, damage/contact and animation
callbacks; they do not inherit main-fight/round, combo or style callbacks.
Rule state is isolated per rule and fighter, including when multiple rules share
one behavior. It never modifies an equipment save.

Saved-instance migrations use the same old-version → next-version function
shape as mod state. Do not retain `self.state` tables to edit later: a successful
callback validates and commits its current copy. Failed callbacks do not commit
state, but gameplay operations already performed are not undone.

Fighter/target/effect methods expire as soon as the callback returns. Keep your
own primitive values, not a fighter object, for later callbacks.
