title: The mod manifest
description: Define your mod's identity, entry script, dependencies, and permissions.
---

Every mod needs a UTF-8 `mod.toml` directly inside its folder. Eclipse reads this file before running Lua. Use the supported simple TOML format shown below: double-quoted strings, one-line arrays, and one `[[dependencies]]` block per dependency. Put all main fields before the first dependency block.

```toml
schema = 1
id = "yourname.training"
name = "Training Equipment"
version = "1.0.0"
authors = ["Your Name"]
entrypoint = "scripts/main.lua"
capabilities = ["content.register"]

[[dependencies]]
id = "core"
version = ">=1.0 <2.0"
```

## Main fields

All main fields in the example are required.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schema` | Manifest format version. Use integer `1`. |
| `id` | Permanent unique identity, using lowercase ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, or `-`. No spaces. `core` and `sf2de` are reserved. |
| `name` | Human-readable name shown in the mod menu. |
| `version` | Your mod's release version, such as `1.0.0`. Increase it when publishing changes. |
| `authors` | Nonempty array of author names. |
| `entrypoint` | Relative Lua path inside `scripts/`, ending in `.lua`. No absolute paths or `..`. |
| `capabilities` | Array of permission names. Use `[]` if none are needed. Duplicate entries are rejected. |

Changing `name` changes the display label. Changing `id` creates a different content owner and can make existing saved items unavailable. Choose the ID before distributing your mod and keep it stable.

## Version ranges

A dependency version such as `">=1.0 <2.0"` accepts versions at least `1.0.0` and below `2.0.0`. All space-separated comparisons must match. Supported comparison operators are `=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=`; an unprefixed version is an exact match. Do not use npm-style `^`, `~`, or `*` ranges.

Depend on versions you have tested against. A range cannot add missing functions to an older build.

## Dependencies

Each dependency requires `id` and `version`. A dependency declares which other content owner you use and ensures it is available before your mod loads. For example, a reference beginning with `core:` requires the `core` dependency above. You do not need a physical `Mods/core` folder; core is built into Eclipse.

To use another mod, add another block:

```toml
[[dependencies]]
id = "other.mod"
version = ">=1.0 <2.0"
```

Replace that illustrative ID with the actual installed mod's ID. Enabling your mod also enables its dependencies. Missing or incompatible dependencies are shown in **Details** in the mod menu. Do not list the same dependency twice.

## Capabilities

A capability permits an operation; a dependency permits references to another owner's content. They are separate requirements. Every function section lists its capabilities under **Requires**.

| Capability | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `content.register` | Register content and use the documented content lookups. |
| `extensions.provide` | Publish versioned Lua services for dependent mods. |
| `extensions.call` | Acquire and call services from declared direct dependencies. See [framework mods](../../api/extensions/). |
| `content.patch` | Supported changes to existing content, such as localization or perk choices. |
| `assets.replace` | Explicit replacement of an existing asset. |
| `state.read`, `state.write` | Read and write mod-owned profile state. |
| `combat.change_life`, `combat.magic_charge` | Supported health and magic-charge methods. |
| `combat.modify_hit`, `combat.effects` | Incoming damage scaling; temporary shields, flags, status icons and player control restrictions, respectively. |
| `combat.modify_outgoing_hit` | Scale an attacker's pending hit during `on_damage_dealing`. |
| `combat.round_outcome` | Declare a round controller with `controls_outcome` and request offline round wins/losses. Native results retain precedence; see [custom objectives](../../api/round-outcomes/). |
| `presentation.dojo` | Select, inspect or reset the saved dojo preference after profile loading. Selection is limited to the mod's own opted-in locations. |
| `profile.read` | Read the active player's level and item ownership/equipped snapshots. |
| `story.events` | Subscribe to purchases, enchantments, experience-driven level gains and initialized scene entry. |
| `story.progression` | Reveal, focus and change saved locks for your mod's own map battles; request the native story-map Eclipse switch. |
| `presentation.navigate` | Request native map, shop, profile and dojo menu transitions. |
| `ui.create` | Open mod-owned UI layouts; returned handles can update and close that script's views. |
| `audio.play` | Play, query, update and stop mod-owned [audio instances](../../api/audio/). |
| `ui.settings` | Register on/off switches shown under Options > Mod settings. |
| `presentation.visuals` | Turn on and tune optional fight visuals, such as weapon trails, bloom and depth haze; create/recolor/remove owned arena markers. |
| `combat.motion` | Queue relative main-fighter displacement for movement abilities; see [fighter motion](../fighter-motion/). |
| `combat.projectiles` | Query and guide this mod’s typed native children; see [live projectiles](../../api/projectiles/). |
| `combat.animation` | Queue explicit playback of a registered move on a main fighter; see [playback](../../api/fighter/#fighterplay_move). |
| `combat.target` | Use supported operations on the opposing fighter. |
| `progression.read`, `progression.write` | Read and update achievement counters. |
| `policy.timers`, `policy.services` | Supported timer settings and service switches. |

For example, a behavior that heals a fighter requires its registration capability and `combat.change_life`. Add the strings to the same one-line array, separated by commas. Permission names must match exactly; requesting a name does not make an unsupported API available.

## After editing

Save the manifest and restart Eclipse. Use **Details** to read validation problems before testing content. See [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/) and [Installing mods](../../api/installing-mods/).
