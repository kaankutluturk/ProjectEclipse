title: VS Code IntelliSense
description: Explore the API, check your mod, and create a complete starter in VS Code.
---

**Eclipse Modding** adds autocomplete and error checking for the entire public Lua
API. Explore functions as you type, look up real assets, and catch common mistakes
before starting the game.

Inside native hit, damage, block and critical callbacks, completion includes
optional `event.attack` with contact actor/move, hit point and tracked projectile
ID/owner. Guard against `nil`, then use these copied fields to distinguish your
projectile's hits. See [combat callbacks](../../api/combat-callbacks/#identify-the-attack-that-made-contact)
for timing and ownership limits. Editor checks do not prove a native contact.

The fight patch fields explain their composition contract in hover:
`append_rules` combines compatible additions across mods; `rules` remains an
exclusive replacement. The Focus and objective starters can run together with
separate HUD placements. See [Combine mods](../combine-mods/) for order and limits;
editor diagnostics do not establish gameplay compatibility.

## Install and enable

The extension is installed from a `.vsix` package, not the Marketplace. Get it from
a successful **Modding editor** workflow artifact, or build it using the
[source README](https://github.com/dawc17/ProjectEclipse/tree/main/Tools/ModdingEditor).

1. Install **Lua** by **sumneko** in VS Code. **3.19.1** is the currently tested version;
   choose it with the gear menu > **Install Another Version** if needed.
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P**, run **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**, and select
   `eclipse-modding-0.1.0.vsix`. Reload when prompted.
3. Open the folder containing your `mod.toml`.
4. Run **Eclipse Modding: Enable in This Folder**.
5. Begin your Lua script with:

```lua
local sf2 = require("sf2")
```

Type `sf2.` and press **Ctrl+Space**. Choose a module, such as `items`, and type
another dot to see its functions. Hover a function for requirements and its full
reference link. Inside a call, **Ctrl+Shift+Space** opens parameter hints.

Version 0.1.0 upgrades the original preview using the same extension ID. It covers
combat, state, quests, equipment, progression, raids, and all other public modules.

## Create your first mod

Run **Eclipse Modding: Create Mod**. Enter a unique lowercase mod ID, display name,
and author name, then choose a parent folder. The command creates a new subfolder
and opens it in another VS Code window. Existing folders are never overwritten.

The starter includes a complete Training Blade: manifest, Lua script, localization,
texture, sprite descriptor, and editor settings. Follow [Your first weapon](../first-weapon/)
to understand the files and install it in Eclipse. The name entered in the command
names the mod. To rename the weapon, edit `weapon.training_blade` in `localizations/eng.toml`.

## Find assets and translated text

Inside a lookup string, press Ctrl+Space to choose a compatible file from your mod:

```lua
local icon = sf2.assets.sprite("sprites/weapon")
local name = sf2.localization.key("weapon.training_blade")
```

Press **F12** on the string to open its definition. Hover a localization reference
to read its translations. Suggestions update as you edit and also work with local
aliases such as `local assets = sf2.assets`.

The index contains your own mod's files. References to `core` or another mod are
checked for a dependency declaration, but their external files are not inspected.

## Write behaviors

Type `eclipse-behavior` or `eclipse-stateful` and accept a snippet. Inline callbacks
infer fighter and event types: `fighter:` suggests operations, and `event.` suggests
event fields. Stateful callbacks receive `self.params` and `self.state`, with
completion for declared parameter and state keys.

Attach the returned behavior handle to a perk or enchantment to use it in combat.
Damage multipliers belong in `on_damage_resolving`; other callbacks cannot change
the hit already being resolved. Follow the combat API reference when choosing events.

Inside a tactic's `on_decide`, `event.` also completes `back_wall_distance`.
Use it to choose forward or backward movement for moves with a native wall
range requirement; guard for `nil` if the script also runs in an older host adapter.

For a guarded native move patch, completion also covers `animation.expected`
and `animation.value`. The value must be an `sf2.assets.binary` handle; put the
replacement `.bytes` file under your mod's `assets/` directory and test its
node layout and frame timing in combat. `remove_interval` completes the exact
native `name`, `type`, `start`, and `end` selector for an unwanted combat interval.
For a complete native move replacement, type `sf2.moves.replace`. Completion offers
the required `target`, `expected_file`, and binary `animation`, plus the typed
move graph. `align.shift_model_node` and `direction` conditions are also covered.
Add `content.patch` to the manifest. The editor can validate the table shape;
test the filename guard, fighter rig and strike in a running fight. See
[native move replacement](../../api/moves-and-tactics/#sf2movesreplace).

## Understand warnings

For a custom win/loss objective, completion offers `controls_outcome` on a
behavior rule and `fighter:end_round` in combat callbacks. A literal enabled
declaration and calls are checked for `combat.round_outcome`. The
`Tools/ModdingEditor/templates/hit-objective` starter combines a timed objective,
round-local state and HUD. Runtime conflict/timing checks and native result
acceptance still require testing in Eclipse.

Framework service authoring completes `sf2.extensions.register`, its schema fields
and `handler(request, caller)`. Consumer lookups complete `get`, `call` and
`try_call`; the editor checks capabilities and direct manifest dependencies.
The framework defines the actual request/response fields, which Eclipse validates
when the service runs. For a complete pair, copy the repository's
`Tools/ModdingEditor/templates/focus-framework` and `focus-addon` folders into Mods.
See [framework mods and shared services](../../api/extensions/) for installation,
ownership and version rules. These templates are separate from the Create Mod
command's Training Blade starter.

Open **View > Problems**. LuaLS checks names, argument types, required fields, and
handle kinds. Eclipse Modding adds checks for:

- Missing local references, wrong asset kinds, and undeclared dependencies.
- Missing capabilities for recognizable API calls, including fighter operations.
- Invalid literal coin/gem prices and damage scaling in the wrong callback.
- Manifest fields, duplicate IDs, unsafe or missing entrypoints, sprite textures,
  unsupported audio extensions, and malformed localization entries.

For missing capabilities, press **Ctrl+.** and choose **Declare ... in mod.toml**.
This edits the capability list; save your manifest before running the game.

**Eclipse Modding: Validate Open Mod** refreshes checks for open Lua files and their
mod's manifest/assets/localizations, then opens Problems. Open other scripts to check
them too. Syntax errors can pause project checks until the file parses again.

## Snippets and settings

Type `eclipse-` and press Ctrl+Space for weapon, behavior, stateful behavior, damage
modifier, saved state, perk, sprite, localization, and import snippets. These are
building blocks: replace placeholders, add files, and declare capabilities.

Enable preserves other Lua libraries and updates existing `.luarc.json` or
`.luarc.jsonc` while retaining comments and unrelated settings. Select **Lua 5.2**
as your Lua runtime; Create Mod sets it automatically. With multiple workspace
folders, commands use the active editor's folder or ask you to choose.
**Disable in This Folder** removes the registered library and turns off project assistance.

If suggestions disappear after an update, run Enable again. Check **Output > Eclipse
Modding** for indexing errors and **Output > Lua** for language-server errors.

## Keep testing in Eclipse

UI definitions complete `on_close` with a typed view handle and close reason.
The Charged Strike template demonstrates clearing local state after HUD closure.

Saved random stream calls complete under `sf2.random`. The editor reports
`state.read` and `state.write` requirements separately, so add both capabilities.
The repository's manual `seeded-trial` template demonstrates a saved encounter
choice; see [Saved random streams](../../api/random/) for bounds and lifetime rules.

The editor cannot prove every dynamically constructed reference, helper function,
schema value, numeric limit, or dependency compatibility rule. Asset checks do not
decode images, models, or sound: a `.wav` filename does not prove PCM16 audio.
A clean Problems panel does not confirm loading, appearance, or combat behavior.

The extension does not install mods, launch Eclipse, or provide live reload or a
debugger. Never copy its `sf2.d.lua` metadata into mod scripts: it is editor-only.

Fighter and opponent completions include `move_by(x, y, z?)`. Manifest diagnostics
require `combat.motion` and, for the opponent, `combat.target`. Calls in fight/round
begin or end callbacks are flagged. The packaged Repulse starter demonstrates
button intent consumed by `on_tick`; game testing is still required for movement.

`play_move(move)` completion requires a typed registered move handle and returns
a receipt with `status` and `error`. Manifest diagnostics require `combat.animation`
and also `combat.target` for opponent playback; begin/end calls are flagged.
Copy the Active Strike starter for an authored punch activated by a HUD button.
See [Activate an authored move](../move-abilities/) for explicit playback and
ability policy. Editor checks do not confirm animation startup or contact damage.

Audio instance functions complete separately from audio asset handles.
`sf2.audio.play` offers typed volume/loop/clock/UI-owner options and an optional
failure reason; `stop`, `is_playing` and `set_volume` require its instance handle.
Literal volume bounds and missing `audio.play` capability are diagnosed. Copy
`Tools/ModdingEditor/templates/audio-lab/` manually for a complete original WAV
and HUD example. See the [audio reference](../../api/audio/); editor checks cannot
verify native pause, source output or device audibility.


Rectangle fields complete for `fighter:overlaps_rect`, `fighter:mark_rect` and
`fighter:mark_sprite(sprite, rectangle)`. Sprite arguments require typed sprite
handles.
Marker handles are distinct from UI/audio handles; `sf2.world` completes removal,
recoloring, geometry/sprite updates and lifetime queries. Opponent sensors require `combat.target`; marker
operations require `presentation.visuals`. Copy the manual `pulse-arena` starter
for a complete moving hazard with cropped atlas animation. See [Arena regions and artwork](../../api/arena/).
Editor checks cannot prove rendered alignment, native contacts or pause cleanup.

The manual `Tools/ModdingEditor/templates/arc-dart/` starter connects typed
projectile item/start-move handles to an owned cast, launch and flight. Its HUD
uses deferred playback receipts. See [Create a projectile ability](../projectile-abilities/).
Editor diagnostics cannot establish native travel, contact, expiry or child damage attribution.

The `return-dart` starter uses `combat.projectiles`. `fighter:projectiles()`
returns callback-scoped `Projectile` references with typed `snapshot()`,
`move_by(x, y, z?)` and `remove()` returns. `lifetime_frames` is 1..600, default 180.
Store copied IDs/positions and reacquire references each callback. Ordinary Lua
turns the trajectory after 28 guided ticks; native attack edges handle contact.


The **Scripted Burst** starter uses `sf2.projectiles.register` and
`fighter:spawn_projectile` for procedural native projectile patterns. Completion
covers the definition, owned handle and `status`, `projectile_id`, `error` receipt
fields. See [Live projectiles](../../api/projectiles/) for timing and ownership.

The **Actor Companions** starter in `templates/actor-companions` includes the playable summon/guide/health/playback/dismiss HUD. Completion covers actor definitions, retained spawn receipts, copied snapshots/events and callback-scoped commands. Declare `combat.actors`; see [Independent fighters](../../api/actors/) for timing, limits and native acceptance scope.
