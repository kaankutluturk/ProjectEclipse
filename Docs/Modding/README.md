# Eclipse Modding wiki

The Astro Starlight documentation site lives in `Docs/Modding/`, outside Unity's
`Assets/` import tree and inside the main Git repository. The site sources,
configuration, build scripts, and npm lockfile are tracked. Dependencies and
generated output are ignored. No Unity editor or game build is needed.

## Run locally

Use Node.js **22.12 or newer** (CI uses Node 22). From the repository root:

```powershell
cd Docs/Modding
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Astro, including `/ProjectEclipse/`.

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The build audits reference coverage against the Lua bindings, runs the source-link
regression tests and Astro's checks, builds the static site and search index, then
checks every local HTML link, fragment, and asset path against the GitHub Pages
base. Output is in `Docs/Modding/dist/`.

Rendered links to this repository's current branch also require a tracked Git
file (`blob`) or directory (`tree`), with exact casing. The check uses the index
so it works in the documentation CI's sparse checkout; ignored/local files do
not establish published source. Deleting or moving an example now fails the
build until its public links are updated. Full-commit historical snapshots are
explicitly outside this current-index check: review their Git tree separately
and label the content as historical. Other unverified branch refs are rejected.
`npm test` exercises this validator independently, including a real sparse Git
fixture, deleted/untracked targets and encoded paths.

## Where to edit

| Content | Tracked source |
| --- | --- |
| Homepage, beginner guides, examples | `src/content/docs/` (`.md` or `.mdx`) |
| Public API reference | `src/content/docs/api/` |
| First-weapon starter and displayed snippets | `public/tutorial/training-blade/` |
| Function coverage audit and alphabetical index generator | `scripts/check-reference.mjs` |
| Sidebar and theme | `astro.config.mjs`, `src/styles/custom.css` |
| GitHub repository and Pages URL | `site.config.mjs` |

Public pages are authored for mod creators, independently of engineering notes
in `Docs/Engineering/Modding/`. Verify function names, fields, types, defaults, capabilities, return
values, and callback timing against the actual Lua bindings and runtime. Do not
copy internal milestone or sweep labels into titles, prose, or code examples.
Keep source links descriptive even when repository paths retain historical names.

Every public Lua function, alias, fighter method, and combat callback needs a
separate level-two heading containing its exact name, followed by **Signature**,
**Returns**, **When**, **Requires**, and a Lua example. Explain shared argument
tables and defaults on the same page. Distinguish complete examples from fragments
that require handles or files created earlier.

`npm run check:reference` inventories the tracked `MoonSharpScriptRuntime*.cs`
bindings, checks dedicated sections, rejects internal milestone labels, and
regenerates the alphabetical `src/content/docs/reference.md` index. Only that
index is ignored; all authored reference pages must be tracked. When adding a
new binding pattern, update the audit to recognize it. This structural check does
not replace checking documentation accuracy against implementation.

`predev` and `prebuild` run this audit automatically. Rerun it when adding function
sections during a development session. Use `pageUrl()` for internal MDX links;
relative links work for neighboring Markdown pages. Add new pages to the sidebar.
The first-weapon tutorial imports its displayed text from the downloadable starter
files so they cannot drift apart.

Keep API and example changes documented in the same change, as required by the
root `AGENTS.md`. Run `npm run build` before handing off. The build also checks
rendered internal links, fragments, assets, GitHub Pages paths, and search output.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

The supplied workflow is `.github/workflows/modding-docs.yml`. It validates
relevant pushes to `main` and pull requests. **Deployment is manual** so the
repository owner chooses when to publish.

1. Commit and push the site, the workflow, and its `package-lock.json`.
2. In the GitHub repository, open **Settings > Pages** and choose
   **GitHub Actions** as the build/deployment source.
3. Open **Actions > Modding documentation > Run workflow** on `main`.
4. After the deployment job succeeds, visit
   <https://dawc17.github.io/ProjectEclipse/>.

The workflow checks out documentation, sample mods, linked tools, and the Lua binding source. It
does not download Git LFS game bundles or build Unity. GitHub Pages receives
only the generated static `dist/` artifact.

For a repository rename or custom domain, update `site` and `base` in
`site.config.mjs` (use an empty `base` for a domain root), update the repository
URL if needed, and rebuild. Configure a custom domain in GitHub Pages separately.
