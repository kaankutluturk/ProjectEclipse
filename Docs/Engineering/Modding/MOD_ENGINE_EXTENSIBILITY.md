# Eclipse as a general Shadow Fight 2 mod engine

The [authored fighter example](AUTHORED_FIGHTER_ACCEPTANCE.md) combines mod-owned
body geometry, connected weighted clothing, an original point animation and
public Lua actor playback. A full installed-mod fight proves deformation,
bidirectional contact and repeated attacks on the standard compatible rig.
This narrows E5/E8 authoring gaps; arbitrary rigs, general importers and complete
creator/platform acceptance remain open.

The player-form follow-up makes that owned character playable through native
Punch selection. A public HUD form request retains canonical player ownership
and combat state; the original strike uses a character-specific input condition.
Switching to a registered core comparison form removes that binding. This is
native controller-dispatch acceptance, not physical-device or general loadout
selection acceptance. See the same authored-fighter evidence record.

Owned fight registration can now declare a typed `player_character` warrior.
Native encounter creation and difficulty evaluation use that character's
parameters while preserving normal player control and round rules. Authored
Fighter Lab supplies a standalone owned fight and repeatable mode alongside its
form comparison HUD. This narrows playable encounter composition; it does not
close general profile selection, arbitrary rigs, menu navigation or exported
platform acceptance.

Prepared encounter plans can also select a typed owned `player_character` from
a Lua preparation menu. The chosen identity is saved with the plan and bound to
the generated fight instance; other instances and the shared blueprint keep
their own selection. Authored Fighter Lab demonstrates cancellation, deferred
entry and a choice between authored and core-compatible characters. Public Lua,
save compatibility and editor contracts pass, alongside 78 native checks for each
player selection in the same authored-fighter record. This advances reusable
mode composition while persistent profile loadouts, arbitrary rigs and complete
creator/platform acceptance remain open.

Supported main-fighter form swaps now preserve owned companions, their bodies,
IDs, private behavior state and existing lifetime. Explicit targets and pending
birth ownership transfer reversibly with the participant. The authored-fighter
record accepts continued native contact after a player owner swap and managed
rollback/queued-birth cases. This advances feature composition; actor-body forms,
arbitrary rigs and general creator/platform acceptance remain open.

The [actor projectile extension](ACTOR_PROJECTILES_ACCEPTANCE.md) supports
typed native ranged abilities on independent roots, with scoped queries,
Lua guidance, caster provenance and retirement cleanup. Ranged Companion Duel
proves controlled native contact and lifecycle; arbitrary content and complete
creator/platform acceptance remain open.

The 2026-10-04 [owned actor API](ACTOR_API_ACCEPTANCE.md) adds a reusable
companion/adversary foundation with native lifecycle, teams and procedural Lua
commands. The [reactive actor follow-up](ACTOR_BEHAVIORS_ACCEPTANCE.md) adds private
behavior state and native contact/damage/lifecycle/animation events. This narrows
E1/E2/E5 gaps; unsupported actor operations, arbitrary rigs and complete
encounter/platform acceptance remain open.

The [scripted actor follow-up](SCRIPTED_ACTORS_ACCEPTANCE.md) proves public
actor spawning and Lua tactic decisions together, including sustained native
contact with isolated controller memory and copied root provenance. This is
bounded core-content acceptance, not closure of arbitrary actor/content domains.

Review date: 2026-09-11. This change adds battle
behaviors. Phase 4 (the downstream DE port) remains deferred pending its assets.
This is an engine-wide extension of the parity roadmap, not a claim that DE or
all engine domains are complete. Missing DE art does not block the work below:
prove mechanics with core assets and purpose-made minimal fixtures.

## Assessment

The foundation is useful: ownership, dependency ordering, transactional
registration, typed asset handles, a Lua sandbox, mod-owned persistence,
instance schemas/migrations, content fingerprints and recovered runtime adapters.
Keep it. The largest limitation is that the public vocabulary often describes
what the recovered XML can represent, while runtime control is concentrated in
perk/enchantment callbacks. Adding more registration tables alone will not make
fully custom modes, characters or UI possible.

The old phase showcases prove selected vertical slices. They do not establish
full field coverage, unrestricted behavior, or full-game acceptance. The existing
`DE_XML_API_GAP_AUDIT.md` G01–G14 remains applicable. This review expands beyond DE
and prioritizes author experience and reusable engine services.

## Coverage against creator requests at the original review

| Domain | Implemented foundation | Missing for genuinely custom content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Battle rules | Typed equipment/attribute/native rules; 0.8 adds direct Lua behavior attachments | Explicit round outcomes, timer control, scoring, fight clock/tick, action restrictions, custom rule presentation |
| Modes | Ordered owned-fight sequences, availability, tickets, replay and progress | Lua-driven branching/selection, resumable runs, generated encounters, mode lifecycle and custom result screens |
| Characters | Warrior templates, equipment, levels, tactics, perks and assets | First-class reusable character identity/controller; playable selection/loadout; stance and form changes; authored rigs/skins |
| Combat | Round/fight, resolving/resolved damage, block/critical callbacks; health, charge, mitigation and shield methods | Rich immutable hit/contact snapshots, motion/grounding/range queries, outgoing hit policy, status effects, projectiles, grabs/throws, ability activation |
| Animations/moves | Native animation binaries, move/template/interval definitions and limited triggers | Published asset spec, authoring/export pipeline, input bindings/combos/cancel windows, hit/hurt volumes, playback capability and animation events |
| AI | Native tabular/random tactics and scoring factors | Bounded decision callbacks, perception snapshots, typed intent/action requests, telegraphs and fallback behavior |
| UI | Recovered quest dialogue, notifications, map entry and service visibility | General mod-owned screens/HUDs, layout, widgets, input/focus, reactive updates and lifecycle cleanup |
| Story | Typed quests and recovered condition/action adapters | Event subscriptions, progression/inventory/equipment queries, asynchronous dialogue/choice results and procedural quest logic |
| Worlds | Static layered locations, spawns, music and sprite assets | Animated scenery, hazards, trigger volumes and supported camera/lighting controls |
| Equipment/sets | Five equipment categories, forge families, perks/enchants, set registration | Non-economic metadata patching, default effects, activated set abilities and level-scaled parameter profiles |
| Assets/audio | Namespaced lookup, sprites/textures, models, binary/audio references, asset redirection | Rig compatibility validation, author previews, animation conversion tools, controllable audio instances and presentation effects |
| Progression | Owned state/migrations, achievements/counters, rewards, sequence progress | Context-rich progress events, owned inventory operations, resumable custom mode state and save version diagnostics |
| Interoperability | Dependencies, ownership and deterministic targeted conflict checks | Public mod-service exports, typed extension points, subscriptions/unsubscription, explicit composition of runtime policies |
| Developer experience | Wiki, LuaLS definitions, VS Code starter/validation, runtime test harnesses | Mod reload in safe contexts, in-game diagnostics/inspector, callback trace/profiler, replayable fixtures and asset pipeline errors |

Source evidence: `MoonSharpScriptRuntime.cs`, `MoonSharpScriptRuntimeP2.cs` and
`MoonSharpScriptRuntimeP3.cs` are the actual binding inventory;
`ModContent*.cs` and `ModScripting*.cs` define contracts; `LegacyContentAdapter.cs`
projects static definitions; `Fight.cs` supplies combat dispatch;
`ModModeRuntime.cs` consumes fixed sequences. The public rules, events-and-modes,
quests, moves-and-tactics, locations-and-locales and fighter pages describe their
limits. The original review had no general custom UI or programmable AI binding;
subsequent delivered API changes are recorded below and in PRE_DE_WORK_LOG.md.

## Design decisions

1. **Separate definitions, behavior, and live instances.** Definitions identify
   characters, rules, moves, modes, widgets and assets. Reusable Lua functions
   implement decisions. Instances own state, subscriptions and cleanup. Do not
   encode branching/arithmetic in action tables. Preserve existing XML adapters
   as compatibility paths, with no obligation to imitate them for new domains.
2. **Use domain capabilities, not raw engine objects.** A fighter may request an
   action or query its state; a screen may update its widgets; a run may select a
   validated encounter. None exposes `Model`, `Roster`, `GameObject`, reflection,
   filesystem access or arbitrary method names. Keep capabilities discoverable in
   completion and report missing capability at the actual operation.
3. **Make rules a first-class host.** A rule must not need a fake enchantment,
   player inventory entry or injected learned perk. Version 0.8 implements this
   part, reusing the tested combat dispatcher and behavior schema/lifecycle.
4. **Read snapshots, request changes.** Event snapshots are immutable observations.
   Intentional changes use named methods with documented timing and results.
   Do not let assignment to a Lua event field appear to mutate the engine.
5. **Publish composition semantics.** Read-only notifications run in stable order;
   bounded numeric modifiers use a documented pipeline; exclusive ownership of
   outcome/camera/input authority has a conflict diagnostic. A second mod must
   not silently win because it happened to load later. Explicit dependencies may
   order compatible overrides. Label order-dependent custom rule interactions.
6. **Keep lifetime explicit.** Callback fighter handles expire immediately;
   screen/run/effect handles last until their owning instance closes. State is
   declared as callback, round, fight, run or profile state. Only supported data
   is persisted. Never save closures, UI objects, native handles or pending
   coroutines. Specify cancellation and what resumes after reload.
7. **One clock contract per domain.** Combat timers follow simulation steps and
   pause correctly; UI animation may follow presentation time. Expose seconds to
   creators, while preserving the native step semantics internally. Seeded,
   instance-owned RNG is required before procedural modes promise reproducibility;
   dependency ordering alone is not deterministic simulation.
8. **Keep the existing economy policy.** No new raw currency, core price or shared
   upgrade mutation. Allow owned counters/resources for modes and abilities;
   distinguish them from base currency. New reward APIs use validated host-owned
   settlement paths. A broader engine does not silently repeal this constraint.
9. **Make errors useful.** Include mod, definition, callback, field path and
   applicable timing in errors. Reject unsupported options; never silently ignore
   them. Offer structured inspect/trace tools before adding large opaque surfaces.
10. **Budget the whole frame as well as each callback.** Current Lua bounds are a
    useful start. Tick handlers, UI updates, spawned effects/projectiles and many
    simultaneous rule instances need aggregate limits and visible diagnostics.
    Limits should be documented and measured, not arbitrary hidden truncation.

## Custom UI architecture

Build an Eclipse-owned UI runtime under `Assets/Scripts/Eclipse/UI/Modding`, with
Unity UI as the initial rendering backend. Avoid public prefab internals, CSS
emulation, a browser runtime, or unrestricted component construction.

A small typed layout tree is appropriate for static presentation: row, column,
stack, scroll, text, image, button, toggle, slider, progress and list/grid. This
is layout data, not a new procedural language. Supply Lua callbacks for clicks,
selection and value changes. A live screen handle updates individual widget
values/visibility and closes the screen. Stable widget IDs make updates cheap;
virtualize large lists instead of rebuilding the entire tree each frame.

Start with three owned mounting points: mod menu screen, modal overlay and
combat HUD overlay. Define their bounds, input priority and lifetimes. Use safe
areas and reference units, anchors, intrinsic/min/max size, clipping and text
wrapping. Default to the game's font/theme, but allow validated namespaced fonts,
sprites and colors. Dynamic text must support localization arguments. Keyboard,
controller and pointer navigation are part of the first implementation, including
focus restoration, Back/Escape and the distinction between decorative and
input-blocking overlays. Combat pause must be an explicit operation/authority,
not an accidental consequence of opening a panel.

Show a plain Lua view-model example: a mode resource changes, the HUD label and
bar update, and a button invokes an ability callback. Do not invent a string
expression language such as `visible_when = "state.energy > 0"`. The callback
can compute visibility and call a typed setter. Cleanup removes subscriptions,
widgets, input capture, sounds and scheduled work on close, scene exit, mod
shutdown or handler failure. No live UI handles are saved.

Acceptance: an interactive loadout chooser; a scrollable branching-mode lobby;
a combat meter with an ability button; localization and resizing; keyboard and
controller use; two mods with overlapping overlays; repeated open/close and scene
changes with no orphan widgets, blocked input or callback leaks. These are planned
contracts; no `sf2.ui` functions are announced by this change.

## Implementation order and exit tests

| Track | Work and dependencies | Required proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E1: behavior hosts | P1A.5 + P2A.1/P2A.3. Direct rule attachments now; then explicit effect/character/encounter host identity | Equipment-free rule, state isolated per rule and side, filter/lifetime tests, unchanged unmodded combat |
| E2: combat control | G06/G08. Hit/query snapshots, simulation clock, statuses, ability/action requests, result authority | A timed objective and custom win/loss rule; correct lethal/timeout/surrender order; no duplicated results/rewards; pause and recursion tests |
| E3: programmable story/run | G01/G02 + P2C. Events/queries/operations, then a persistent Lua mode controller | Branching roguelike trial with seeded choices, a loss route, safe save/disable/reinstall and one-time settlement |
| E4: owned UI | Extend P2B.3 beyond visibility flags; may proceed after lifecycle services | The three interactive UI fixtures above, focus/input and teardown checks |
| E5: character/animation pipeline | G05/G07/G08/G09 + P1D.4/P1D.5. Publish native format constraints before building exporters | A new move with timing/contact data, custom input/AI use, multi-stage boss/form, invalid rig rejected with actionable error |
| E6: world/presentation | G10 + P1D.2/P1D.3. Animated layers, audio instances, hazards, camera intents | Arena with timed hazard and telegraph, pausing correctly and unloading cleanly |
| E7: breadth and patching | G01/G04/G11/G12/G13/G14. Targeted content collections, metadata, conditions, services | Composition tests with two mods; disabling restores base behavior; missing mods preserve owned saves |
| E8: authoring and stabilization | Tooling, diagnostics, compatibility policy, versioned examples across E1–E7 | A newcomer builds a rule, mode, character and UI without editing recovered source or learning obfuscated names |

E2/E3/E4 should share cancellation, authority and instance lifetime foundations.
Do not create three unrelated callback/state schedulers. Deliver small complete
vertical slices in this order; keep later domain designs provisional until their
actual engine seams are recovered. Third-party skeletal formats, animation
retargeting, extra simultaneous fighters/team combat, rollback/network play and
arbitrary renderer replacement each need dedicated feasibility work. They are
not implied by accepting a new character or binary asset ID.

## First delivered slice and limits

Exposes `sf2.rules.behavior`. Its state is isolated by rule and fighter;
mode/round/target filters apply at dispatch; rule parameters enter content
fingerprints; saved-lifetime behavior is rejected. Static projection omits these
rules from native XML rule execution. `Fight.DispatchEclipseCombatEvent` and
`DispatchEclipseOpponent` dispatch them before each side's existing perk handlers.
No fake inventory/perk entry is made. Lua operations keep existing capabilities
and scope expiration. A rule error is isolated; previous host operations remain
applied. Shield keys include the rule/fighter instance identity through `ModInstanceFighter`.

`Mods/example.battle-rules` provides an equipment-independent third-hit guardian
using core art. It is a generic engine fixture, not the DE port. This addresses
part of E1; it does not satisfy custom outcome, tick, AI, UI, or full rule-editing
exit criteria. At this baseline, core fight patching could not change rule lists; append/replacement is now supported. Phase 4 remains
unstarted, and no absent collaborator assets have been replaced or invented.

Validation results belong in the task handoff; managed/native fixtures are not a
substitute for a full encounter playtest. Before stabilizing 1.0, every promised
public domain needs definition and runtime consumption, namespace/dependency
checks, deterministic composition, lifecycle/missing-mod/save semantics, tooling,
current wiki pages and an end-to-end creator fixture.

## Verification of this slice

- All four managed project builds passed (Unity 2022.3.62f3 references).
- `Tools/Tests/Combat/TestBattleRules.ps1`: 92 checks, including actual MoonSharp execution,
  transactional rejection, target/mode/round filtering, per-rule/side/round/fight
  state, pending damage, capability enforcement and parameter fingerprints.
- `Tools/Tests/Combat/TestP2ACombatRuntime.ps1`: existing behavior/migration/capability and
  mode/progression regression fixture passed; its prerequisite content showcase
  fixture also passed.
- `Tools/Tests/Progression/TestUnderworldRuntime.ps1`: 1,282 assertions passed. The separate
  `AuditUnderworld.py` still reports missing loose raid-location images; it is not
  a clean asset-coverage result.
- Editor definition generation/check and seven project tests passed. Actual
  LuaLS and isolated VS Code integration passed; these are authoring checks.
- Wiki build and function coverage/link/search checks passed.
- No full Unity encounter playtest was performed for the new battle rule.
  Native animation/rig, controller input and custom UI acceptance are future
  work; managed tests do not prove them.

## Follow-up: combat observations

`fighter:snapshot()` now captures fresh health/max-health/bar count, arena model
position, the opposing fighter, and active-fight frames/seconds. The runtime
contract uses detached immutable C# values and copied Lua tables. Live queries
expire at callback exit; data already returned may be retained. Missing sources
return nil. Rule wrappers forward the observation source, so the same method
works through all existing combat behavior hosts. The Third Strike Trial now
loses its guard at one third health using this API.

Evidence: Model.KKMCHCNOHMB and ModelParameters.CIDCNCDFONA are the normalized
current/maximum pool; HealthBarCount supplies authored bars. Model.PLBNCDCFPML
returns model position. Fight.RenderFight increments fightTimeInFrame only while
round.processing; Fight initialization resets it, and existing elapsed-time
accounting divides by 60. The API reports this existing clock without changing it.

This is an E2 observation slice, not completion of combat control. No tick
subscription, animation state, action request, custom result authority or UI
binding is added. Those still require their own lifecycle and engine integration.

Verification: all four managed builds pass; the battle-rule fixture
passes 104 checks, including fresh snapshots, detached nested values, expired
queries, missing opponents/sources, clock conversion and the low-health rule
transition. The existing combat suite and 1,282 Underworld assertions pass.
Editor generation/check, seven project tests, actual LuaLS (including snapshot
return inference and the full updated example), and VS Code integration pass.
The wiki builds 41 pages with 98 public binding sections and 3,057 checked local
links/assets. The asset audit still reports missing loose raid images. No full
Unity encounter or pause/playtest was performed; the native observation adapter
is compile-checked and based on the engine sources cited above.

## Existing encounter editing

Fight patches now append or replace rules and replace location/music. This closes
the direct-rule host gap for existing campaign content and part of G01. See
[the cumulative work log](PRE_DE_WORK_LOG.md) for verification and remaining work.

## Outgoing hit control

Attacker-side callbacks and bounded scaling are now implemented before defensive
stages. Pending hit flags are observable. See PRE_DE_WORK_LOG.md for source-order,
Lua and example checks; native gameplay and the remaining E2 controls stay open.

## Native combo and style observations

Behavior handlers can observe native combo changes/expiry and style rank
transitions. The combo-reserve example combines these observations with round
state, the combat clock and outgoing scaling for a timed bonus. Its expiry is
evaluated by subsequent callbacks; this does not supply tick subscriptions or
status UI. See PRE_DE_WORK_LOG.md for the complete checks and native playtest
limits. An eventual tick host needs explicit ordering around model updates and
round settlement, plus cached subscriptions rather than full profile scans on
each simulation frame.

## Active combat ticks

`on_tick` runs before model/collision updates on each active combat frame, with
an explicit frame/seconds/delta payload. Native pause gates the simulation and
round processing gates clock advancement. Session handler subscriptions are
cached after registration freezes, and absent handlers skip parameter/state
resolution. Active equipment/perk eligibility is still read from the native
host to preserve in-fight suppression; this is not a cached mutable loadout.
The combo-reserve example now clears expired state on ticks. Native pause/round
gameplay and performance profiling remain pending. General asynchronous tasks,
UI lifetimes, status presentation and action/outcome authority remain separate.

## Owned UI foundation (internal)

An engine-independent scope/surface/tree model and Unity UI view now implement
bounded widgets, live updates, guarded button callbacks and deterministic
cleanup. Managed ownership tests and an isolated Unity play-mode fixture pass.
This is not a published Lua capability: mount/input coordination and script
lifetime integration are still required. See
[the implementation evidence](UI_RUNTIME_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for exact source,
supported internal primitives, native verification limits and remaining work.

The internal scene coordinator now implements modal/menu/HUD ordering, bounded
mounts, safe-area fitting, foreground input, Back, navigation ownership and scene
cleanup. Its isolated Unity fixture includes overlapping mod canvases. Game
entrypoints, native dialog/input routing and Lua lifetimes remain to be wired;


The game bridge now routes native dialog/Back/combat input ownership, preserves
closing-frame consumption, and supplies on-demand mounting. Script contexts own
UI scopes. Lua creation and handle methods remain the next integration boundary;
full-game physical input acceptance is still pending despite passing isolated
Unity bridge checks.

Now publishes the initial owned UI creation/update/close contract and
a Charged Strike HUD with bounded click logic and fresh combat authority. The
public Custom UI reference and editor definitions describe the exact limits.
Full E4 remains open for native end-to-end acceptance, richer layout/assets/
localization/widgets, HUD controller focus and the broader creator workflows.

Adds safe-area anchors/offsets to owned UI and connects the actual Charged Strike Lua example to the production Unity renderer in an isolated play-mode fixture. See [the UI implementation evidence](UI_RUNTIME_IMPLEMENTATION.md). Full-game acceptance and broader widget/mode workflows remain open.

Adds dynamic localization reads for Lua/custom UI, with current-language selection, English fallback and pending/committed patch support. Charged Strike exercises English/Polish refreshes in the isolated Unity fixture.

Establishes native game skin defaults for custom UI, per the user requirement, and adds bounded text/color styling. Future widget types must use the same original-game visual language by default. See the UI implementation evidence for native asset and preview coverage.


Adds bounded Lua mode-result routing over registered fight rosters and
persists the selected step using existing mode storage. A standalone Branching
Trial demonstrates alternating short/full routes and loss routing. Native outcome,
reward and entry paths remain authoritative; malformed callbacks fall back.
Linear completion indicators are suppressed for these modes. This advances E3,
but does not deliver generated fights, seeded run services, asynchronous choices,
full custom lobbies/results or complete interruption acceptance. See the cumulative
work log for exact runtime/editor evidence and the remaining requirements.

Adds deterministic random draws backed by ordinary declared integer
state fields. Integer ranges use bounded rejection sampling; both draw functions
require owned state read/write capabilities and resume from serialized state.
Seeded Trial connects this to actual Lua result routing over registered fights.
This supplies persistent seeded choices for E3; generated encounters, async
player choices, lobbies/results and transactional run settlement remain open.


Adds bounded UI close notification after input/view teardown, with
explicit reasons and prevention of reopening UI during cancellation. Charged
Strike demonstrates canceling pending gameplay state on native HUD destruction.
This advances the E3/E4 lifetime foundation. Async mode entry, lobbies/results,
subscriptions and general cancellation services remain open.


## Implemented extension update

Procedural generation now produces saved typed encounter plans over registered
fight blueprints. Modes/events/raids can defer entry with an owned `on_prepare`
request and resolve it from UI. Programmable tabular AI receives playable actions,
fighter snapshots and isolated transient memory. The character pipeline now spans
Blender point-rig import, evaluated motion/skin export, validation/preview, native
animation baking, model bindings and scoped playable moves. Native-styled toggles
and sliders expand the UI contract. Generated Expedition and AI Dojo demonstrate
the new behavior through ordinary Lua; editor/wiki contracts ship alongside it.

This advances E2/E3/E4/E5; it does not declare the entire roadmap complete. Remaining
work includes full-game acceptance, broader AI perception/control beyond selecting
native playable actions, automatic cross-skeleton retargeting, richer UI asset and
list/text-entry controls, custom lobbies/results and general asynchronous services.
Requests cover mode preparation rather than arbitrary coroutine/network execution.
The cumulative work log records checks and the manual checklist identifies the
remaining in-game tests. Phase 4 remains deferred pending collaborator assets.


## Visual character authoring follow-up

The primary authoring workflow now prepares Gymnast Tool Suite's supplied visible
SF2 IK body and packages native exports into a repeatable map preview with authored
move selection. The point-rig importer remains a low-level tool; its earlier format
checks did not prove a complete visual creator workflow. Source-pose comparison,
missing-node rejection, actual model export, Lua registration and native reading
are verified. Custom controllers/forms, broader motion operations and full-game
rig/skin/contact acceptance still prevent closing E5. See PRE_DE_WORK_LOG.md and
the public Gymnast guide for reproducible commands and exact boundaries.


Publishes source-aware whole-quest suppression, with ownership/conflict
validation, patch fingerprints and startup application before saved resume.
The source file remains distinct from the saved loading container. This advances
E3/E7 and G01/G14; it does not implement individual action editing or programmable
story subscriptions. Native full-game resume remains an acceptance requirement.

## Animated location pictures

Typed image curves now project to native picture effects: horizontal/vertical
motion, rotation and opacity, with phase offsets and bounded points. The shipped
Animated Arena demonstrates drift/fade using core art. Lua and native interpolation
fixtures pass; full-game rendering/lifetime acceptance remains. E6 is still open
for hazards, atlas effects, audio instances/playlists and camera control.

Adds typed location music_choices and native random track selection at
fight entry. Audio choices are validated and fingerprinted; Animated Arena uses two
core tracks. This advances G10/E6 without claiming sequential playlists or audio
instance control. Native selection checks pass; audible playback remains unverified.

Dojo host prerequisite: native ChangeDojoLocation now affects the next FightNone
construction instead of retaining the training definition's cached location.
Normal encounter locations are unchanged. This is verified by 29 routing checks,
not a persistent/public dojo selector. G03 still requires choice ownership, profile
state, menu integration and full scene acceptance.

The dojo preference store now passes 37 save/lifetime checks, including preserved
selection while its provider mod is absent. It is not connected to catalog/Lua/menu
or the game profile lifecycle yet. Public selector capability remains pending;
G03 remains open.

Connects dojo opt-in registration, profile binding, select/query/reset Lua
operations and next-entry native resolution. The Dojo Selector example uses the
existing game-styled UI through a map preparation callback. G03 is advanced, not
closed: native menu extension/scene navigation and full-game persistence/render
acceptance remain. See PRE_DE_WORK_LOG.md for test scope.

Adds permission-gated profile level and per-item inventory snapshots.
These are fresh read-only queries, usable from UI/combat callbacks, advancing G02
and G13. Full story/query/event coverage remains open, and live profile/inventory
acceptance is pending. See the work log and public profile reference.

Profile lifecycle follow-up: mod binding now occurs at active roster assignment,
not shared roster construction. Comparison copies cannot steal the active profile.
Reset/unload unbind queries, dojo/modes and Lua state without deleting saves.
Production-method and state fixtures pass; subscriptions remain future work.

The story notification transport now has owned disposable scopes, deterministic
delivery, callback failure isolation and bounded nested dispatch. Thirty checks
cover cancellation, profile boundaries, capacity and error handling. It is not
connected to Lua or native purchase/enchantment sources yet; no public story
subscription API is available at that foundation checkpoint. See the work log.

Connects the transport to native purchases and enchantments, active profile
lifetime, and Lua story.on/off/is_active subscriptions. Capture happens before
native quest evaluation and delivery afterward, preserving native results. Owned
callbacks are bounded and cleaned up on script disposal; stale profile captures
are rejected. Story Observer is a runnable logging example. Native method/Lua,
editor and documentation checks pass; full-game acceptance and broader event/query/
operation coverage keep G02/E3 open.

Adds experience-driven level_up subscriptions with original/final level
snapshots. The native legacy level-up quest event has no dispatch source, so the
new notification is attached to completed roster experience processing instead.
Only the active roster can publish, with profile-generation protection. Multi-level
and capped gains are tested; direct level assignments and profile loading stay
silent. The legacy scene-loaded event was found to precede asynchronous loading,
so a usable scene/UI-ready notification still needs a later lifecycle boundary.

Adds scene_enter at that later boundary: a scene-owned coroutine is
scheduled after native Init, module registration and widescreen setup, then yields
a frame and verifies the active/requested scene and profile generation. Map, shop,
profile, dojo and fight are supported. This is initialization, not dialog dismissal
or combat readiness. Existing UI close callbacks retain scene teardown semantics.
Production-method/coroutine and Lua menu-opening fixtures pass; actual Unity scene
unloading and full-game input remain unverified. Native menu insertion/navigation,
broader story operations and the rest of G02/G03/E3/E4 remain open.

Unity scene-lifetime follow-up: 15 isolated play-mode checks now verify real
deferred delivery, unload, profile replacement and disabled/reactivated owners.
This found and fixed a pending entry that could revive on reactivation: OnDisable
now invalidates and removes the helper. Full-game native scenes and custom menu
rendering/input remain acceptance work; the broader gaps remain open.

Adds scenes.open for map/shop/profile/dojo menu transitions. It preserves
native quest/tab gates, rejects active combat/loading/dialog/lock/preparation states,
and guards reentry. The result acknowledges acceptance, not completed loading;
scene_enter observes arrival. Scene Menu demonstrates game-styled navigation UI.
Native/Lua fixtures pass; full-game transitions and native menu insertion remain
open, along with the wider story, UI and mode workflow requirements.

Scene Menu Unity follow-up: the production UI fixture now loads the shipped Lua
example and verifies its game font/sprites, bounds, rejected/accepted button flow,
native blocking, directional submit, scene coordinator teardown and remounting.
The complete fixture passes 99 checks. Navigation responses remain controlled;
native game scene transitions and physical-input acceptance are still open.

Adds ordered opponent-list replacement to existing fight patches, with
registered warrior handles, conflict detection and preservation of other encounter
fields. Lua and projection fixtures pass; full-game opponent/progress acceptance
remains pending. G01/E7 remain open for rewards, other core domains and broader
composition. See PRE_DE_WORK_LOG.md for verification limits and remaining per-call
patch rollback hardening.

Exposes scoped reward_drops patches for existing fights. Registered item
rewards replace direct drops in one result/mode/level scope while preserving native
economy and other scopes. Registration, conflicts, fingerprints, Lua and adapter
connections are implemented; native settlement/full-game acceptance remain open.
This advances G01/E7 without closing broad reward acquisition or lottery coverage.

Adds learned-perk queries through profile.perk, allowing story and custom
UI logic to inspect native learned status and upgrade without mutation. Active
combat effects remain a separate gap. Host/Lua/editor checks pass; full-game perk
learning/reset/save acceptance remains pending. See PRE_DE_WORK_LOG.md.

Adds runtime type/subtype to profile.item snapshots, including unowned
items. This supports classification in custom story/UI callbacks with known item
handles. Host/Lua/editor checks pass; full-game item metadata acceptance and broader
story queries/core metadata editing remain open.

Connects item_acquired notifications to native grant count increases.
This advances G02/G13 for procedural acquisition logic; purchase and acquisition
notifications are separate observations and may both occur for one purchase.
Universal inventory events and full-game acceptance remain open.

Makes profile item/perk queries accept qualified IDs at runtime, preserving
capability/dependency checks. This removes the need to preregister handles for
items discovered by story callbacks. Automated host/Lua/editor checks pass; broader
query/operation coverage and full-game acceptance keep G02/E3 open.

Adds profile.equipment for equipment-sensitive story/UI conditions,
including unknown native records and their available metadata. It reads profile
inventory rather than temporary fight equipment. Native-method/Lua checks pass;
full-game acceptance and broader operations keep G02/G13 open.

Adds battle_result story observations with captured encounter identity,
outcome, Eclipse state and available player model equipment. Tracked encounter
and profile lifetime guard delivery. It advances G02/G13 without claiming deferred
lottery settlement, arbitrary result authority or full-game acceptance.

Lottery recovery now preserves the archived slot weights and exposes native
eligibility/reward/presentation data to host code. The recovered constructor had
ignored Weight across all 154 archived slots. This is a tested parser prerequisite,
not a functioning lottery or public loot API; G04 remains open.

Lottery host selection now supports weighted, level-filtered candidates with
injected randomness and caller exclusions. Tested independently of inventory and
presentation; no live lottery or Lua binding consumes it yet. Settlement and UI
remain G04 work.

Selected lottery slots can now build native reward results without granting them,
preserving item enchantments and nested lottery payloads. Builder tests pass;
settlement, UI and archived UpgradeLevel expression semantics remain open.

Lottery claims now have tested in-memory draw/claim ownership and profile affinity.
Duplicate/reentrant claims cannot grant twice, and unresolved nested lotteries are
rejected before grant. No live UI/quest consumer yet; crash-safe settlement and
partial native mutation recovery remain open.

Lottery live claims now defer story notifications until their grant/save-request
boundary succeeds. Nested batches retain FIFO delivery and shared budgets; failed
or stale batches discard observations. This is not native rollback or disk durability,
and no lottery UI/quest consumer is enabled yet.

Legacy reward UpgradeLevel expressions now use the native player-level evaluator
and encoded upgrade lookup, separately from ordinal UpgradeNumber. Native parser
and selection fixtures pass; actual archived item-table coverage and full-game
settlement remain unverified. Lottery UI and durable recovery keep G04 open.

Profile writes now use a recoverable snapshot/hash journal, replayed before native
profile loading and discarded on intentional reset/replacement. Disk and native
adapter fixtures pass, including recovery in a fresh process. This supplies a
persisted-write boundary for G04; prepared lottery claims and their UI/quest
workflow remain unfinished, and full-game restart acceptance remains pending.

Lottery helpers now persist an evaluated pending prize before returning, resume it
without drawing again, and save completion with the native inventory change.
Settlement defers native saves; failed grants block later saves until profile
reload. Native/lifecycle and payload fixtures pass with stated controlled services.
No live UI/quest consumer exists yet; full-game settlement and recovery remain
unverified, so G04 remains open.

Follow-up: custom UI images now change in place through the public
sf2.ui.set_sprite function, retaining the original-style container and layout.
Runtime/Lua/isolated Unity and editor checks pass; full-game acceptance remains
pending. The earlier lottery notes above are historical: the current saved claim,
quest and battle presentation implementation is documented in PRE_DE_WORK_LOG.md
and the public save compatibility page. Paid spins, multiple pending claims and
full-game crash acceptance still keep that domain open.

Adds fixed-column grid UI containers, consuming the shared game-styled
widgets and supporting ordered focus with automatic vertical scroll reveal.
Runtime/Lua/isolated Unity/editor checks pass. This does not implement virtualized
collections or spatial four-direction navigation; full-game acceptance remains.

Navigation follow-up: grids now use directional geometry for arrows and
D-pad/stick, alongside Tab/Shift+Tab traversal. Sliders retain horizontal input
at their endpoints. Isolated Unity and bridge routing checks pass; device/game
acceptance and virtualized collections remain pending.


## Arena regions and owned markers delivered

The world/presentation track now has pose-based XY rectangle sensors, filled
arena-local warning markers and the shipped Pulse Arena Lua hazard. Static region
geometry is a typed four-number rectangle; ordinary Lua controls warning/active/
recovery timing and contact policy through the existing combat tick. Markers have
script/round lifetimes and explicit per-script/session bounds. The actual native
collision-edge list, margins and radii are queried, including collidable equipment
edges; no pivot approximation or generic arithmetic DSL is introduced.

Full-game Campaign/core Tournament 3 acceptance verifies warning/recolor, native
projection, actual contacts/direct health changes, pause/resume, recovery,
recurrence, shared bounds and surrender/owned-resource cleanup. A native lifecycle
fix stops both sides' script ticks after round/fight-end dispatch. This supplies
the timed hazard/telegraph proof for that controlled scenario, not closure of E6
or the Minecraft-style objective. Solid/swept physics, arbitrary actors, general
camera controls, all-arena/form and exported-platform acceptance remain open.
See the creator work log and public arena reference for source and limits.

## Creator projectile ability delivered

Arc Dart composes existing typed content, queued fighter playback, scheduled
child creation and attack/deletion actions into a native projectile. Lua controls
activation and cooldown. Full-game controlled Campaign acceptance verifies
visible flight, real native damage with main-caster Lua attribution, pause,
hit deletion and miss expiry. Native scheduled actions now retain reentrant
events for the next pass. This is a finite compatible missile graph; live child
handles, general actors, homing/bouncing, arbitrary physics and original rig
acceptance remain open. See the creator work log and projectile guide.

## Independent actor feasibility evidence

The native model lists support a third root with separate cloned health, visible
rig/equipment and an explicitly started attack that damages the player with the
correct native attacker identity. A controlled full-game probe now verifies those
facts, third-root knockout without ending the main duel and requested removal.
Its 27 checks are not an actor API: bounded AI observation remained in idle, and
native enemy registration, cached targets, side-based node bindings, callback
identity, death ownership and round results still need explicit integration.
See ACTOR_FEASIBILITY.md for source seams, the accepted scenario and next proofs.

The follow-up repairs own-move initialization for controllers joining any active
fight and animation-start routing to the actual starter plus registered root
enemies currently targeting it. Strict full-game acceptance now forbids explicit
attack playback and passes 180 checks, including two distinct native attacks,
contact attribution, correct own/target observations and removal. This supersedes
the earlier idle observation for that core cloned fighter. It remains feasibility
groundwork: no public actor definition/instance/behavior or team API is delivered,
and arbitrary rigs/tactics, owner/child lifetimes and encounter policies remain.

The target follow-up adds an internal transactional hostile-root/target binding
seam for a root and its existing weapon children. It aligns cached target,
animation and event identity; clears old-target AI observations/waits/throttle;
and restores exact touched state on synchronous failure. Selected-first registry
order keeps the legacy fallback aligned. It does not select the nearest enemy,
change construction's mutual hostility or restart the current move/collision phase.
The corrected 303-check native run requires a subsequent attack start after first
contact, then proves incoming extra-root damage after redirecting the original
opponent, unchanged excluded player health, new-target node bindings, immediate
rollback and original-duel restoration/removal. The prior 180-check repeat claim
had a weaker start/contact ordering assertion and is superseded. General actor
ownership, public targeting, teams, different rigs and lifecycle remain open.
